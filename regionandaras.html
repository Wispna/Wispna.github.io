                    <p><strong>Region Name:</strong> Andaras</p>
                    <p><strong>Capital City:</strong> Alorin: The Capital - home to the emperor as well as the main church.</p>
                    <p><strong>Primary God:</strong> Alorel</p>
                    <p><strong>Races:</strong> 55% Feroxi, 35% elves, 8% humans, 2% everything else. Elves are particularly looked down on in this region, and are never in high social positions. Many of the elves here are simply here because they are vestiges of what's left from when the Andaran empire was in elven hands rather than feroxi hands.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Andaras is a large empire belonging mainly to Feroxi, having grown larger in recent years due to the current empire claiming surrounding lands in the name of spreading the word of Alorel as the main goddess.</p>
                    <p>The empire is highly religious, and it is enforced that its inhabitants must primarily worship Alorel. The empire also believes that Feroxi are the ideal race, and they are the only people treated with true respect. However, even among the Feroxi there is status based on what sort of animal they are connected to. Birds are among the highest, as they are closest to Alorel’s form and are blessed with wings. Nearly all birds have noble blood, and are destined for high positions within society. Mammal Feroxi are more middle class, though a few are savvy enough to work their way up the ranks. They are the most common type of Feroxi found in the empire. In the last tier are reptile/amphibian Feroxi. They are somewhat rarer, and are looked down on as being closest to the ground. They are never given high positions, and must make their way in poorer stations in life-- only regarded slightly higher than non-Feroxi.</p>
                    <p>In Andaras it is highly taboo for Feroxi to marry a type of animal below your station, and even more so to wed a non Feroxi.</p>

                              <p>Rinnea and her guard is primarily under the rule of the militaristic Earl who has final say in all important decisions, but is generally well respected among the guard, but it also has secondary leaders-- one captain of the day guard, and one captain of the night guard. The night guard is generally regarded in a worse light by the general public since it's the night guard that enforces the curfew, while the day guard tends to be more popular and have more pomp and circumstance around them.</p>

Formally neutral and independent of any region's claim, but has been under Andaran influence for around 500 years. Despite this, it continues to remain a cultural mixing ground, and diverse location.</p>

                    <p><strong>How the rest of Tiranthe views them:</strong> Conquering, power hungry, yet powerful</p>
                    <p><strong>Issues this country faces:</strong> Civil unrest, religious persecution, harsh imposed social status differences, fairly new emperor, while simultaneously new controversial leader of the church of Alorel, racism</p>
                    <p><strong>What’s the economy like?:</strong> Booming! Andaras is a wealthy country, and have an economy based on coinage, and from time to time barter and trade.</p>
                    <p><strong>What is their currency called?:</strong> Therins. Counterfeit coins by mineral mages are prevented by treating every coin in a substance that none but the government know how to make. This substances makes it so that when coins are dipped in water, the metal temporarily turns bluish.</p>
                    <p><strong>What are the main languages spoken?:</strong> Feroxi, Elven, trader’s common</p>
                    <p><strong>Where do most people live?:</strong> Near the river and the capital city</p>
                    <p><strong>How does this country view magic?:</strong> It’s a useful resource/weapon, and should be pursued, but technology, intelligence, and physical prowess is far more admired, and seen as coming from your own strengths. Andaras is a good place to go if one wishes to learn to be a doctor without using magic, though generally if you want such education, it's best if you're Feroxi.</p>
                    <p><strong>How technologically advanced is this country? Is magic preferred?:</strong> Technology is preferred, though they like mixing technology and magic from time to time. Andaras is fairly decently far along technology wise. They have plumbing, nice architecture, steel, roads, and a writing system. Where their technology is lacking is in naval pursuits. Andaras has poor ships that are only good enough to make mercantile journeys to nearby ports.</p>
                    <p><strong>How is history recorded?:</strong> Written down and in books. Oral stories are very popular as well.</p>
                    <p><strong>How many are educated, and how?:</strong> Academics wise, mostly those with the wealth to do so. Schools exist for many different types of disciplines, but one must pay to get in. Some lucky individuals can manage to get themselves a scholarship. Even wealthier individuals pay for personal tutors.</p>
                    <p><strong>How did the majority of current people come to be on this land?:</strong> They conquered it 500-200 years ago.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why do people choose to live here?:</strong> It’s got nice weather, good natural defenses, lots of resources. Terrain wise it’s a great place to live, and if you’re a high end Feroxi there’s no place better.</p>
                    <p><strong>How popular is the government?:</strong> Not popular. Only well liked among higher end Feroxi.</p>
                    <p><strong>How are criminals charged and punished?:</strong> They are tried in a trial, then either jailed, publicly humiliated, or executed (alternatively you can choose to join the Andaran army. If you cause issues within the army you are usually executed). Trials aren’t always fair, and any trial can be overridden by a mandate from the emperor.</p>

                    <p><strong>What are popular legends?:</strong> Thousands of years ago, Feroxi did not have their animal forms or features. Enemies were taking their homes and food, and 3 villages sent 9 chosen to go to the lands of the gods and ask for aid. Alorel, charmed by their dedication, gave their people their new forms to help defend themselves, and gave the 9 chosen and their villages the forms of birds.</p>
                    <p><strong>What were major wars/disasters in the past?:</strong> The conquering of elven lands that later became the Andaran empire 500 years ago.</p>
                    <p><strong>Who are famous individuals?:</strong> Emperor Aetherius, Holy Exarch Gwydion, Princess Maera, the now deceased Empress Vitaria who began the campaign to conquer the nearby elven lands 500 years ago.</p>
