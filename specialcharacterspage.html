            <h3 class="poiret">Half-Bloods</h3>
            <p>Half-blood characters are characters that have parentage from two separate races. Due to social stigma, and the rarity of half-bloods being able to be born in the first place, half-bloods are an uncommon sight.</p>
            <p>Half-bloods tend to resemble their mothers more-- they tend to take on more features of the mother's race including aging, affinity, and appearance-- and must physically be something that could feasibly be born from their mother's race. Half-blood characters are also physically unable to bear children of their own.</p>
            <p>​All half-bloods come of age when they reach 18.</p>

Many feroxi view this as giving up the gift that Alorel gave them, and as a result can hate half-bloods more than they hate non-feroxi.</p>
                        <p>When making a feroxi half blood remember that feroxi only bear children when in human form, so if a feroxi is the mother, the half blood must be something that could feasibly be born from a human.</p>

                        <p>For an elemental half blood to be born, their non-elemental parent must have shared an innate magical affinity with the elemental parent. This means that the affinities of the non-elemental parent's race must be taken into account. (e.g. a feroxi's innate affinity can only be fire, nature, water, or air, so if a half feroxi/half elemental is born, the elemental parent must have been fire, nature, water, or air). Due to elementals being unable to have an affinity of light or dark, light or dark elemental half-bloods are impossible. </p>
                        <p>Elemental half-bloods tend to take on more features of the non-elemental parent, even if the elemental is the mother due to not being born from occurrences in nature. They must also eat like a non-elemental person to be able to survive.</p>
                        <p>Due to elementals being so rare, and having no society of their own, the way an elemental views half-bloods heavily differs from elemental to elemental.</p>

            <p>A human, elf, or feroxi may be one of the fortunate few that is blessed with the Sailor's Mark. This mark, gifted to the descendants of 6 sailors from long ago, allows characters with it to breathe underwater, as well as grants them slight aquatic features. This mark also grants characters abilities when they're beneath water depending on where it's located on their body.</p>
            <p>The mark is not visible on all descendants of the original 6 sailors, but only on those that have been baptized by full submersion at a moon temple by the sea. Only then will the mark appear, and the differences in your appearance/the marks benefits occur.</p>

                            <p>Long ago, none knew there were fully functioning cities and people beneath the surface of the water. There were 6 sailors/fishermen scouring the sea during a full moon, but a storm had whisked them all overboard. Having all been respectful and loving of the sea, all of them prayed for forgiveness of whatever had brought this misfortune onto them.</p>
                            <p>Luwaria took pity on them, since they were frequent and respectful visitors of her domain. With her mercy, they were all then given the mark of the sea, giving them slight aquatic features, and allowing them breathe underwater. Disoriented, they all swam towards a light, which they thought was to the surface. Instead, they were greeted with the twinkling lights of an underwater city. There, a light lead them to a priest in an underwater temple. The priest told them that they have been blessed by the goddess to live and be able to live in the shallower cities that the sea had to provide. Delighted, some of them stayed but the others decided to go back and tell their stories.</p>

                            <p>Those in Tiranthe that contain considerable power of the divine are known as demigods. Demigods have powers beyond most mortals, that are often related to the powers of the existing gods. There are countless ways that demigods come into being, though the most common ways are children are born of a god and mortal parent, or a god grows to particularly favor one mortal, and as a result takes them as a favored servant, and gifts them their own divine powers. Often with this second method, demigods can live out much of their lives in a godrealm serving the god that had given them their favor.</p>
                            <p>Some demigods may not be directly related to a singular god at all, though this is far more uncommon. Instead they have somehow gained powers that rival the divine through any number of methods. If you want to go with this route, it will be up to you as the creator to decide how this happened.</p>
                            <p>Nearly every demigod is long lived-- they are not immortal-- a demigod can still be killed if their wounds are too great, or if they contract too deadly an illness and don't receive healing. It is more difficult to kill a demigod than it is a mortal through such means, but it is definitely very possible.</p>
                            <p>If a demigod remains healthy, however, they can live for eons. This is uncommon, however, for demigods tend to attract lives of strife.</p>
                            <p>Demigods still require discussion with a mod to be made, as we may be able to help flesh out their lore, and their connection to existing gods.</p>
                            <p>Godrealms are odd dimensional realms that suit the tastes of the god that created them. Often there are hidden passageways to visit different godrealms hidden throughout Tiranthe, though often if the doorway is found once, it is closed and moved elsewhere to avoid having too many pesky mortals going where they don't belong.</p>
                            <p>Demigods require at least 3 in their blessings stat.</p>

                            <p>Demigods have a single ability in ADDITION to what they can buy with their attribute points. This ability is often connected with the god they are connected to, but you are free to make it up in a way that best fits their character. The ability can involve stats, or it can be more rp involved such as shapeshifting, telepathy, etc.</p>
