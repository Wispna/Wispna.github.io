                    <p><strong>Capital City:</strong> Chakir</p>
                    <p><strong>Primary Gods:</strong> Solq & Nahite</p>

                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A mostly unruly country, the biome varying wildly from location to location, from the coldest stony souths to the spiny desert norths. Dragons congregate in small families for the most part, living nomadic or village-like lives. There are common grounds often visited for crafting, shelter, worship, celebrations and more, but the most notable of places are the two cities that break from those expectations; Chakir, and Daiyur.</p>
                    <p>Daiyur exists as a sole kingdom built on the backs of Elves seeking shelter from Feroxi attacks. It stands now as a hub for many species with a majority of fire dragons acting as royalty. Many dragons visit this city to do trade or socialize. There is a misinterpretation outside of Scatha that Daiyur is the capital.</p>
                    <p>Chakir, the true capital of Scatha is the meeting place of the known dragon elders. Located deep in the Spine range caverns, it is near impossible to find without a guide, the interior is a more traditional take on dragon’s living. Their history, laws, and famous arts can be found decorating the endless stone walls of Chakir.</p>

                    <p><strong>Region Name:</strong> Scatha</p>
                    <p><strong>Capital/Notable Cities:</strong></p>
                    <p>Chakir: The capital city located underneath the Spine Range. The richness of Draconic history can be found here carved along the cavern walls. Wealth and artifacts are hoarded here. The elders of tribes meet here to make major decisions, and is a popular location to raise a family. It is considered the capital by the Dragon people.</p>
                    <p>Daiyur: The largest city by population of Scatha. Refugees of the mainland wars gather here, offered protection by the Fire Dragon tribe in return for labor. The city is ran much like a monarch. </p>
                    <p><strong>Government Type:</strong> Gerontocracy</p>
                    <p><strong>Population:</strong> Small</p>
                    <p><strong>Population Type:</strong> 75% dragons 8% merfolk 8% elves 6% humans 3% elementals</p>
                    <p><strong>Primary God:</strong> Solq</p>
                    <p><strong>Other Popular Gods</strong> Nahite</p>
                    <p><strong>Major Landscapes:</strong> Scatha is one of the most densely varied regions. Northward you can find both spiny forests, and bleached deserts, along the Spine range mid, rainforest, branching further away turning to woodlands and meadows, and finally rocky tundra far south. </p>
                    <p><strong>Major Resources:</strong> Silk, salt, semi precious stones, bauxite, magnetite, glass</p>
                    <p><strong>General Climate:</strong> Subtropical with a hot, rainy season, and cool, dry season. However, it is highly dependent on altitude and location.</p>
                    <p><strong>Influence Over the World:</strong> Limited </p>

                    <p><strong>How the rest of Tiranthe views them:</strong> Wild, uncivilized, dangerous.</p>
                    <p><strong>Issues this country faces:</strong> Dispute in government, lack in reliable justice, medical, housing, food and water. Institutional racism, no governed market prices or employment rates.</p>
                    <p><strong>What’s the economy like?:</strong> Wealthy for locals. Many families have wealth hoarded and unspent from early ages the dragonic race looted from the mainland. However immigrants suffer from the untapped resources and often find them relying on draconic employment or becoming thieves. </p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What are the main languages spoken?:</strong> Draconic</p>
                    <p><strong>Where do most people live?:</strong> Daiyur</p>
                    <p><strong>How does this country view magic?:</strong> Positively, a major staple of day to day life and culture.</p>
                    <p><strong>How technologically advanced is this country? Is magic preferred?:</strong> Magic is preferred, in the majority of Scatha Dragons live a nomadic lifestyle, however Daiyur makes leaps and bounds in technological advances off of the information migrating elves brought overseas. </p>
                    <p><strong>How is history recorded?:</strong> The majority of their history is recorded on the cavern walls of Chakir. Daiyur are making leaps and bounds in transcribing it to paper against the wishes of the major draconic opinion. Elves being made to translate and transcribe are making attempts at finding easier ways to write, one in particular working on a printing press with the fine dyes produced in Scatha. </p>
                    <p><strong>How many are educated, and how?:</strong> Most have a non-traditional education. By an academics sense, the majority of the country is highly lacking. However, stories, skills, and information is all passed down by word of mouth and an entire dragon family will participate in a young one’s education. </p>
                    <p><strong>How did the majority of current people come to be on this land?:</strong> Most were born to the region, landlocked there. However few managed to make the long voyage by boat and luck. </p>
                    <p><strong>Why do people choose to live here?:</strong> Dragons form a close knit society and can be rather wary of the outside world, so they do not leave. Others have come seeking shelter from the wars, or knowledge and culture that the Dragons hoard from the rest of the world. </p>
                    <p><strong>How popular is the government?:</strong> Currently the opinion is very half and half. Some desperately wish for reform, while others are complacent in their ways. </p>
                    <p><strong>How are criminals charged and punished?:</strong> Most are given punishment by the nearest elder if there is a question on the charge, however, it is not uncommon for disputes to be handled between citizens without care. Most punishment including corporal punishment, or in extreme cases, banishment from Scatha. There isn’t any sort of jail and family crimes are kept quiet in order to keep their pride. </p>

                    <p><strong>What were major wars/disasters in the past?:</strong> Early depictions along Chakir walls tell of a time that dragons would go to the mainlands to find food, steal riches, and cause general destruction. This behavior stopped when a raiding party went extremely poorly against a Feroxi city, and advanced weaponry ended with a majority loss on the Dragon’s side. </p>
                    <p><strong>Notable Holidays?</strong> Day of Conjugation is when a dragon is deemed old enough to obtain their human forms. This normally happens around fifty years of age, an elder arrives to help the young dragon channel their magic in a ritual. The young Dragon envisions to the best of their ability how they would think themselves to look as a humanoid, and over the course of 12 hours solidifies the idea into a physical form. It can not be changed, so the family normally encourages them to think long and hard on how they would like to appear.</p>

                    <p><strong>Popular Clothing Types?:</strong> Dragons wear a type of poncho that can easily be worn in either their human form or dragon form. Depending on their village, there are many kinds that are made. Some are tighter fitted with many folding layers of fabric held together by magnets sewn into the seams, or simply a large quilt with holes for the head and arms. This is fluid, but in general is very detailed and adorned with items they hold precious as dragons hold very little trust for others and find that the safest place for their things are on their person.</p>
                    <p>Family jewelry is an important aspect of their culture. Many pieces are worn that are passed down through their generations or gifted between villages on friendship voyages. The most important piece is their necklace which is crafted for their day of Conjugation, by their family, pieces are given by the elder as well or by neighbors who favor the child. This necklace holds the same uses as a belt would for many, it is big enough to fit around their draconic necks, and is often bulky and firm but can be slimmer based on region. While some hold nothing but their beads and gems, others keep their purses, weapons, flasks, or other daily items upon them. </p>
