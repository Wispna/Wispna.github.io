                        <p><strong>Primary Region:</strong> Dreto is regarded as the heart of human civilization, however humans are found in most of Tiranthe. Kessa, Triem Sha, and Nirios are other popular regions with noteworthy human settlements.</p>

                        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Ubiquitous and well known, humans thrive in communities big and small across the land. Human life spans are short compared to most other races, and their physical strength is seen as lesser by many, but their versatility and adaptability make them a notable force that has accomplished many great feats throughout history.</p>
                        <p><strong>Physical Appearance:</strong> You know what a human is. Hair colors extend beyond the usual black, brunette, blond, and ginger, but stay in more muted and desaturated territory.

                        <p><strong>Primary Region:</strong> Wafetia is the capital of elf diplomacy and heart of Elven culture, although elves can be found in most of Tiranthe.</p>

                        <p><strong>Physical Appearance:</strong> Approx. 5 to 6 feet; skin, hair, and eyes can be any color, although most elves’ skin comes in tones that are close to humans (aside from variants)</p>

                            <p><strong>Description:</strong> From the City of Malveria in the Kessa region, these Elves are notable from ordinary elves by their lively colors and unique markings that adorn their skin and glow. Sometimes these markings extrude from their skin into interesting crystal shapes and adornments as well.</p>

                            <p><strong>Physical Appearance:</strong> Malverians are like normal elves in physique and physical stature. Their skin, hair, and eyes can be any color, but skin, hair, and eyes should all be similar in color. Many Malverians are born with slightly glowing irises and glowing intricate, tattoo-like birthmarks</p>
                            <p>In color theory lingo, their colors can be seen as monochromatic or analogous.</p>

                        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Hailing from the cold tundras of Selpharas, these elves are known colloquially as “the cold ones”, and in a less friendly manner, “the frigid bastards”. Said to have migrated south many years ago from Wafetia, they have adapted to prefer colder climates.</p>
                        <p><strong>Physical Appearance:</strong> These elves are pale and desaturated. Their hair colours tend towards white, platinum, lavender, and such tones. They have a colder body temperature compared to their warmer brethren and don’t do well in hot climates. Their eye colours also tend to be light-coloured.</p>

                            <p><strong>Primary Region:</strong> Andaras</p>
                            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Every Feroxi can change from their human form into an animal form of a bird, mammal, or reptile/amphibian. The animal form will often be larger than whatever species it is based off of-- slightly so if the animal is already large, very much so if the animal is very small. E.g. If a Feroxi has the ability to change into a mouse, the mouse will be at least a foot tall. In animal form, a Feroxi has the capabilities that that animal would have in nature.</p>
                            <p>Feroxi also have a better sense of smell/hearing than humans would while in humanoid form, and this can be enhanced depending on what features remain while a Feroxi is in human form.</p>
                            <p>Feroxi children, rather than being any blend of animals, will take the form of an animal that was in their ancestry. They are most likely to take the form of one of their parents, but forms from up to 4 generations back are possible.</p>
                            <p><strong>Physical Appearance:</strong> A Feroxi’s human form is mostly the same as the average human, but with short pointed ears (shorter than an elf's), and slight animalistic features from whatever animal a Feroxi is able to change into. Hair/eye color can also be derived from whatever animal a Feroxi can change into.</p>

                                    <p>Feroxi can grow feral if they remain in their animal form for too long. This is usually based off of their SORC stat. A feroxi with 0 sorc can remain transformed for half a day without growing feral, and then for feroxis with more sorc they can remain transformed for 1-1.5 days per sorc point. After reaching their limit, Feroxi will feel exhausted, and will require AT LEAST an hour of rest before transforming again. Constantly pushing their limits will be hard on the feroxi both mentally and physically.</p>
                                    <p>Sleeping can slow the process of growing feral by 2-3 times.</p>
                                    <p>This is a rule of thumb, and storytelling will take precedence.</p>

                            <p><strong>What is their social structure like?: </strong> There is a strict social hierarchy within Feroxi culture in Andaras, where the majority of them live. Birds are at the top, Mammals are in the middle, and reptiles/amphibians are at the bottom. Only birds will be allowed to take ruling positions, and they will often be wealthy as well. Mammals are middle class, though bats often have an advantage at becoming higher middle class or working for a noble family due to having wings. Reptiles/amphibians are low class, and will tend to have more labor intensive jobs. Venomous reptiles/amphibians have a reputation for being assassins or criminals, and often have more trouble finding work, or individuals that trust them. Generally even reptiles/amphibians are considered to be above other races, however.</p>
                            <p><strong>What are family units like?: </strong>  The nuclear family is still common, though it isn’t unusual to have siblings, uncles, aunts, grandfathers, and grandmothers living with you as well. Adoption is also incredibly common, particularly if you are a bird, have bird blood, or are a higher end mammal.</p>
                            <p><strong>What is naming structure like? First name - last name?:</strong> Just a first name and a last name, no middle name. If you aren’t in a noble family, some do away with a last name entirely.</p>
                            <p><strong>What foods are preferred?: </strong> It depends on what animal you are. Fruits seem to be pretty popular, however. Milk isn’t drunk that often.</p>
                            <p><strong>Who/what is their predominant god/religion?: </strong> Alorel.</p>
                            <p><strong>What is marriage like?:</strong> You ask the other to marry you, then together you go to a priest who will decide if you as a couple will be blessed. If this is the case, the priest will give you and the other an emblem of whatever god we have in charge of marriage, and you wear it upon your person. Once the families are informed, a feast is held, as well as a traditional dance, as well as a solitary prayer with only you and your spouse within a temple, and then you’re married.</p>
                            <p>If the priest tells you you as a couple aren’t going to be blessed, you either decide it’s not meant to be, or you defy fate and get an emblem of Alorel mixed with the emblem of whatever marriage god we have, and hope for the best. No feast/dance is held in case it would be seen as insulting to the gods, but a solitary prayer is. This route is viewed as foolish, but also romantic, and absolutely must be avoided for nobles.</p>
                            <p>You can bribe a priest to say that your union will be blessed.</p>
                            <p>Both sides in the union keep their surnames. Any children will take the surname of whatever parent has the most influence, or whatever parent they choose. Optionally they can take none at all.</p>
                            <p>This is primarily an Andaran ritual. Feroxi that have chosen to live elsewhere, or have chosen a different religion may take up the practices of other cultures, or make up their own.</p>
                            <p><strong>What do they do with their dead?: </strong> When you die you are washed, dressed in white, given an emblem of Alorel that is placed on your forehead, then buried. A single hymn is sung, and your belongings aren’t touched for three days.</p>
                            <p><strong>What traits do they find most admirable?: </strong> Being a bird, intelligence, calmness</p>
                            <p><strong>Notable cultural taboos?: </strong> Marrying and particularly having children with a non Feroxi. When a Feroxi child is born, they will take on the animal traits of four generations back. A half feroxi/half other will be unable to transform, and if you are a bird and you don’t wed a bird you’re looked down on. Same if you’re a mammal and you wed a reptile/amphibian.</p>
                            <p><strong>What time of day are they most often awake?:</strong> Day.</p>

                            <p>Poorer buildings are often made of stone into blocky houses that serve their purpose.</p>
                            <p><strong>What are popular forms of art?:</strong> Music, theatre, sculpture, paintings, pottery</p>

                            <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Up to 50 years on average</p>
                            <p><strong>Growth speed:</strong> Slightly faster than humans</p>
                            <p><strong>Age of Maturity:</strong> 18</p>
                            <p><strong>Elemental Affinity:</strong> Mineral or Fire</p>
                            <p><strong>Primary Region:</strong> Ishari</p>
                            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Xanthi are a race which feature strong animalistic features and fur. They are far more bestial than the Feroxi with claws and whiskers and talons, but they are all bipedal. They tend to populate in tribes of the same species and have a strong warrior culture. They often worship Bao-rha, the Xanthi god of valour.</p>
                            <p><strong>Physical Appearance:</strong> Xanthi take after four-legged animals such as tigers, bears, lions, deer, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, rabbits, cats, etc. They are more bestial than Feroxi with fur all over their skin and a distinct lack of human features. Most Xanthi tend to be quite tall and large, with the average Xanthi being around seven feet tall and the tallest Xanthi around ten feet tall.</p>
                            <p><strong>Naming Convention:</strong> Xanthi have a strange naming tradition. They tend to be named after the first thing they killed along with the weapon used, or vice-versa. Some younger Xanthi who are more rebellious have bucked this tradition, however, and are renaming themselves with less weird names.</p>
                            <p>Some common Xanthi names include:</p>
                            <p>Daggerhound</p>
                            <p>Fanggrim</p>

                        <p><strong>Elemental Affinity:</strong> Mineral or Water</p>
                        <p><strong>Primary Region:</strong> Seaside Ishari</p>
                        <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Xanthi which live near the water embrace more of a seafaring culture. Their lifestyle consists of fishing, taking voyages to the sea with great boats, harpooning and hunting in the ocean.</p>
                        <p><strong>Naming Convention:</strong> Unlike Inland Xanthi, Nautical Xanthi are often named after natural phenomena. Common names such as Galewind, Zephyr, and Typhoon are popular. There are only so many natural phenomena, however, so in order to differentiate their children from others with the same name, they have increasingly outlandish spellings of names such as Tai-Foon.</p>
                        <p>Some common names include:</p>
                        <p>Hurricane</p>
                        <p>Hoo-rikahn</p>

                            <p><strong>Age of Maturity:</strong> 50</p>
                            <p><strong>Elemental Affinity:</strong> Water, fire, air, nature, lightning, mineral</p>

                            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Dragons are powerful scaled beasts. They are amalgamations of creatures that mirror the environments they are born from so they come in many varieties. They have two forms, learning a second more human form later in life.</p>
                            <p><strong>Physical Appearance:</strong> A Dragon’s elemental affinity dictates a lot of their appearance, including their hair, skin, and eye color. A water dragon might have whites, blues, and greys, while a fire dragon would come in reds, browns, and yellows.</p>
                            <p>The human form of a dragon is their secondary form, learned later in life. Their human form keeps similar colors to their dragon form, as well as horns, ears, and other general draconic features. The height of a dragon’s human form varies wildly, as due to their more isolated mostly-dragon societies, there are many misconceptions of just how big a humanoid is. Their dragon forms are rarely smaller than a pony, but not commonly larger than a two story building.</p>

                            <p>Shore: approx. 100 years</p>
                            <p>Open Ocean: approx. 200 years</p>
                            <p>Abyss: 800 years</p>
                            <p><strong>Growth speed:</strong> Similar to human speed until their 20s or 30s before it massively slows down.</p>
                            <p><strong>Age of Maturity:</strong> 20</p>
                            <p><strong>Elemental Affinity:</strong> Water is most common across all types. Abyssals can also be dark. Shore can also be lightning. Open ocean can be water, dark, or lightning.</p>

                            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Merfolk are a hybrid of a human upper half and a sea creature lower half. All merfolk have clawed fingers, and predominantly live underwater. There are three categories of merfolk (shore, open ocean, and abyss), each with its own distinct characteristics.</p>
                            <p>Typically, when they are in their bipedal form, Merfolk’s legs tend to be longer than the typical human, due to their tails being longer than human legs.</p>
                            <p>Something to consider when creating your mermaid is that everyone wears family jewels that are passed down from generation to generation.</p>

                        <p>Shore merfolk have the most contact with the “dry fish”. They can comfortably switch from having a mermaid tail to being bipedal simply by drying themselves off when leaving the water. They are the smallest (4’10-5’10 in bipedal form) and most colorful variant of the three types, they can even have colorful coral horns. Shore merfolk variant tends to be the most human- like in appearance, with ears that are less fin-like than the other two types. They are also the only variant that can have human skin tones. Shore merfolk are also the only ones that can have human hair.</p>
                        <p>There are cold region Shore merfolk as well. Their tails are fuzzy, like seals, and are shades of off white to off black. If they have horns, instead of coral, they have more dark or narwhal-like horns.</p>

                        <p>Open Ocean merfolk are the biggest of all the merfolk. In bipedal form, they normally range from 5’7 to 7’0.  They are more territorial, because unlike Shore merfolk, they cannot go to the surface without needing magical assistance, and unlike Abyssal merfolk, they cannot stand the water pressure of the deep abyss. Their skin tones are always cool and unnatural, and they have pointy teeth and slit pupils. Their ears are more fin-like than human-like. Their bodies are adorned with stripes and markings which vary in location and appearance from merfolk to merfolk.</p>
                        <p>Typically, Open Ocean merfolk are muscular or heavier set as a means of protecting themselves from other creatures. The more frail/skinny an Open Ocean merfolk is, the more difficult it is to live a normal life.</p>

                        <p>Deep Abyss Merfolk, Abyssals for short, are the most respected variant among the merfolk. They have been around the longest, and are even rumored to be placed there by goddess Luwaria herself. Abyssals look the least human and most “alien” of the three. They are typically lanky in nature, roughly 5’0-6’5 in bipedal form. Their scleras are never white. They typically have pastel skin tones or deep dark ones. Their bodies are accented with neon colors due to their natural bioluminescence. The females tend to be larger than the males. This variant is the only type that can live within the high water pressure of the Deep Abyss, and are considered the more intelligent, esteemed people of the mermaid society. Their “deformities” are revered in the underwater society, as it makes them alien-like, which in turn makes them closer to the image of Luwaria.  </p>
                        <p>They cannot go to the surface easily, and need magical assistance. (E.G enchanted jewelry, clothing, etc.) When Abyssals go onto land, other races often find them strange looking, due to their alien nature (extra limbs, extra eyes, potentially bigger mouths, anything under the sun, really). These design features also carry on to their more humanoid form.</p>

                            <p><strong>Where do they primarily live?: </strong> Yuani</p>
                            <p><strong>How common are they?: </strong> Very common in the ocean</p>
                            <p><strong>What are unusual weaknesses they might have/dangers they have to watch out for?:</strong> Fire and dry heat.</p>
                            <p><strong>What is their social structure like?: </strong> Abyssal females are generally the highest rulers of Yuani. Many look down on those from the Open Ocean, since they have to resort to their strength rather than their intelligence to get advantage over others. Shore have the privilege to be able to easily roam the dry land, so they are typically foreign diplomats for Yuani, and the Abyssals are the ones that are in charge.</p>
                            <p><strong>What are family units like?: </strong>   The mother has the first say in most things, but parents in the modern age have an equal voice with their children. All family is treasured, so many families live in the same area for many generations.</p>
                            <p><strong>Are genders equal?: </strong> Matriarchal leaning society</p>
                            <p><strong>What is naming structure like? First name - last name?:</strong> Traditionally, first name, (mother’s last name)-(father’s last name). For the next generation, they take their first last name to use for their child.</p>
                            <p>For example:</p>
                            <p>Mother: Onceler Ed-Helms</p>
                            <p>Father: Jack Frost</p>
                            <p>Child: Bob Ed-Frost</p>
                            <p>In recent years, however, tradition has often been ignored.</p>
                            <p><strong>What foods are preferred?: </strong> Any human food, except they can also digest raw foods with ease, though they still preferred them cooked. </p>
                            <p><strong>Who/what is their predominant god/religion?: </strong> Luwaria</p>
                            <p><strong>What is marriage like?:</strong>For the ceremony, they perform a choreographed traditional dance, wearing their most flowy clothing and adorned with all of their family’s jewels. This only happens during the night, so they too can have Luwaria’s blessing, as the moon reflects onto the water. </p>
                            <p><strong>What do they do with their dead?: </strong> They are transferred to holy burial grounds, which are forbidden territory to cross unless it is for visitation. Typically, the bodies are not disturbed, due to not wanting to interrupt the process of the body and soul turning into stone. </p>
                            <p><strong>Any other notable rituals?: </strong> Before an important exam or interview, the mermaid dons their most successful family member’s clothing. This is common enough that traditional clothing is still in high demand, since the clothing is rebought to fit them properly.</p>
                            <p><strong>What traits do they find most admirable?: </strong> Knowledge, honesty, wit, creativity, innovation.</p>
                            <p><strong>Notable cultural taboos?: </strong> Wearing none of your family jewels, unless you are particularly estranged.</p>
                            <p><strong>What time of day are they most often awake?:</strong> Day.</p>

                            <p><strong>Growth speed:</strong> They incubate in elemental rocks until they emerge as an older child. They age like humans until their 30s, after which their aging slows indefinitely.</p>

                            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Elementals are extremely few in number and are very spread out, even their villages are extraordinarily small. They are typically born from occurrences from nature, such as a lightning elemental being born from a great thunderstorm, though that is rare. From a need of nature, for example, a dying forest needing life, so a nature elemental is born to bring it back to health. They could also be born from abundant energy or a large magical concentration of an element. This would appear as a glowing, motionless orb for a long time before it turns into an elemental stone. Elementals can also be born from a coupling of two elementals.</p>

                            <p>Any color from ROYGBV</p>

                            <p>White, yellow, blue, sometimes orange.</p>

                            <p>Elementals also have horns that correspond to their element. For example, Water would have ice horns, Fire would have molten rock with peaks of fire, so on and so forth. Nature elementals are also allowed to have mushrooms or huge mushroom caps as their horns. Wooden horns work as well.</p>
                            <p>Elementals are one solid element, so mixtures are not possible. Usually, Elementals don their hair as their element. For example, Fire Elementals have fiery hair on their head. They can, however, choose to present with solid hair as well. This goes for any element. Elementals can have regular ears or pointy, elven ones.</p>

                        <p><strong>Race Name:</strong> Golems</p>
                        <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong></p>
                        <p>Natural variant: up to 1000 years</p>
                        <p>Manufactured variant: approx. 100 years </p>
                        <p>As a Golem ages, the source of its lifeforce, its core, loses its energy. When the core loses all of its energy, the Golem dies, regardless of the condition of its body. The core is believed to be a countdown to the reincarnation of the Golem to their next “true” life.</p>
                        <p><strong>Age of Maturity:</strong> They don’t age, so they are born mature.</p>
                        <p><strong>Elemental Affinity:</strong> Any. Their core color reflects what their main affinity is.</p>
                        <p><strong>Primary Region:</strong> Anywhere, but a lot are first found in the ocean.</p>
                        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Golems are unusual beings that are usually known as non-sentient in Tiranthe. Because of this, most of the population has never considered a Golem to be a ‘person’.</p>
                        <p>However, while obscure and rare, sentient Golems have existed in society, blending in successfully with their non-sentient counterparts.</p>
                        <p>A Golem’s body is simply the vessel to the essence of a being that once lived, concentrated into their core stone. The energy collects into this core over many years until it solidifies into stone, which, depending on whether the Golem is a natural variant or a manufactured variant type, naturally clings to the debris around it, or is inserted into a vessel artificially. As the body is merely a vessel, it does not feel pain.</p>
                        <p><strong>Physical Appearance:</strong> A golem is humanoid in shape and can range in height from 2 feet to 9 feet tall. The vessel of a Golem is made of a hard mineral material. Materials can come in various forms such as rocks, shells, crystals, metals, etc. so long as the material was not previously living like flesh, plants, trees, etc. </p>

                            <p><strong>Variant Name:</strong> Organic</p>
                            <p><strong>Primary Region:</strong> None</p>
                            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Organic Golems are born when a core stone collects energy in an area for long enough to connect with its environment. It emerges, fully formed, from its birthplace to wander the earth.</p>
                            <p><strong>Physical Appearance:</strong> They are made of non-living materials, no flesh or plants, and are still humanoid in shape but can take on rather creative forms. They are usually organically shaped, but as their body is merely a vessel and feels no pain, can be forcibly reformed into different shapes through physical effort.</p>

                        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Unlike their organic brethren, Artificial Golems are man-made vessels that are fused with magic and brought to life with a core stone.</p>
                        <p><strong>Physical Appearance:</strong> They are made of non-living materials, such as porcelain, metal, or gems. As they are artificially crafted, they can be highly sculpted and detailed, like dolls, armor, sculptures, etc.</p>
