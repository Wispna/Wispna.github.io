            Your character’s art should be a full-body coloured piece. Please download <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/canine-unit/art/Curse-of-Raehn-App-Template-839694891">this psd</a> and put your character’s image on the application. A few notes:</p>
            <br>
            <p>-No commissioned art for the application. We are an art-heavy group, so while we appreciate good writing - it would be extremely difficult for a non-artist to fully participate in the group.</p>
            <p>-No bases or traces. For the same reasons as stated above.</p>
            <p>-New art please! - We allow submission of applications for in-game currency, so please try to draw new art for your app.</p>
            <p>-Please try to follow the general guidelines for how your race looks physically from the races journal.</p>
            <p>-Please note that the character will have the <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/wispna/art/Curse-Mark-843066317">Curse Mark</a> on their body somewhere, it does not have to be visible unless it's in a prominent place.</p>

            <h3 class="poiret">Application: Written</h3>
            <p class="emphasis">**PLEASE HAVE YOUR BASIC INFO IN THE DEVIATION DESCRIPTION. [History, Personality, Miscellaneous, and Abilities] can be on a separate google doc you link, but please have [Name, Age, Height, Race, Elemental Affinity, Country of Origin, Favored God, and Stats] on the deviation.**</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Please follow naming conventions if their race specifies any.</p>
            <p><strong>Age:</strong> Please keep these in line with the race chosen.</p>
            <p><strong>Race:</strong> One of the available races.</p>
            <p><strong>Elemental Affinity:</strong>The magical affinity of your character should align with their race.</p>
            <p><strong>Country of Origin:</strong>Where they came from before they arrived in Raehn.</p>
            <p><strong>Favored God:</strong>Which god do they primarily worship?</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Stats:</strong>(18 Stat points to start. You must have at least 1 point in VIT, or your character is dead? Each stat is capped at 8 max.)</p>
            <p><strong>VIT - </strong>Every point in Vitality is essentially how many successes you can take before you go down. One point of Vitality is one point of HP.</p>
            <p><strong>PHYS - </strong>This deals with traditional feats of the human body, such as demonstrations of strength, speed, and nimbleness.</p>
            <p><strong>SORC - </strong>Magical Ability.</p>
            <p><strong>ACA - </strong>An educational knowledge. Academics covers history, politics, geography, understanding technology and creating it, economics, popular religious customs, the ins and outs of magical theory, and investigation. </p>
            <p><strong>LORE - </strong>A more traditional knowledge. Lore covers stories, songs, useful plants, creatures that roam the world, customs of places you've traveled, perception, and you have more of a hold on rumors. Maybe someone with high Lore doesn't know all the religious custom and rituals, but they'll know of the godly myths.  </p>
            <p><strong>BLESS - </strong>Occasional aid from your god/goddess. Luck, in a way.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Personality:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>History:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Physical Type(s):</strong>If you go the physical route, or want physical abilities: You will want to choose from one of the 6 branches.</p>
            <p><strong>Magic Type(s):</strong>If you go the magical route, or want magical abilities.</p>
            <p><strong>Ability Doc:</strong>A google doc off-site with your character’s abilities. If you wish to put them in the app instead, you may list them here instead.</p>
                <p>( Physical Abilities: The abilities you purchase with Attribution Points. Please use the calculator for all calculations.)</p>
                <p>( Magic Abilities: The abilities you purchase with Attribution Points. This will be the same pool as used for physical abilities.)</p>

    <section class="main-img">
        <div class="info-box2 clearfix">
            <p><strong>Personality:</strong></p>
            <p>Please describe your character’s personality. You hate it and we hate it, so you don’t have to write x amount of positive and negative traits unless that’s your thing. Please just try to make a balanced character with flaws. This should be at least a paragraph long.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>History:</strong></p>
            <p>Explain your character’s history before they arrived at Raehn. Ideally this might involve the region they came from previously. It can be their whole life’s story or just the highlights. If you would prefer to keep some elements ~*~*secret*~*~, that’s fine! Just send a fully unlocked version of your character’s bio with your app check note for the mods to check.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong></p>
            <p>Please note where your character's curse mark location is here! Are there any other details you would like us to know about your character. Do they have a cool tattoo? A talking bird that’s always with them? Are they allergic to fantasy blueberries? Put all that gold in this section.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Stats:</strong></p>
            <p>Our combat system relies on rolling 6-sided dice with 5s and 6s as successes. The number of dice you are allowed to roll for a trait depends on the number of Stat points you have in them.</p>
            <p>Someone with 5 stat points in physical traits will be allowed to roll 5 dice when making a physical attack or physical move.</p>
            <p>If you want to make a physically based character, you may prefer higher traits in PHYS, if you are making a magically inclined character, you may prefer higher traits in SORC, and if you prefer a mixture you might want to split the difference.</p>
            <p>Allocate your 18 points however you would like. You can even have 0 points in any trait except vitality if you would like.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Choose your Combat Type:</strong></p>
            <p>You can now choose your character’s ability traits. You can go full physical, full magical, or any mix in-between. These abilities do have mechanical features in-game, but they can also have roleplay features and do not necessarily have to be used for combat. All these abilities will cost Attribution Points. For full details, please refer to the Physical Tree and Magic System docs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a quick overview:</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Physical Types:</strong></p>
            <p>The Nimble</p>
            <p>The Deft</p>
            <p>The Stalwart</p>
            <p>The Hardy</p>
            <p>The Mighty</p>
            <p>The Wiley</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Physical Types:</strong></p>
            <p>Water</p>
            <p>Fire</p>
            <p>Air</p>
            <p>Nature</p>
            <p>Lightning</p>
            <p>Mineral</p>
            <p>Light</p>
            <p>Dark</p>
            <br>
            <p>All Ability types are further stratified between Minor, Moderate, and Major abilities. You may not obtain a Major ability before obtaining its Minor and Moderate.</p>
            <p><em>Minor -> Moderate -> Major</em></p>
            <p>If you wish to specialize in multiple ability types, you must first master at least 1 Major ability in an ability type before learning a new one.</p>
            <p>The physical and magical types are also organized in a circle. The further a type is from another, the more attribution points it will cost to learn an ability from the other type due to the extremely different or clashing natures.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Someone who is learning the MIGHTY path (red) will have greater difficulty learning from the DEFT path (green) due to the very different natures of the two/distance on the circle and therefore it will cost them more Attribution Points.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Someone who is on the LIGHTNING path (yellow) would have greater difficulty learning the MINERAL path (brown), shown in the distance on their circle/path, and thus it would cost them more Attribution Points.</p>
            <p>
                At level 1, you have 30 attribution points to allocate between physical or magical traits or both. Some races will have access to certain magical types that others do not. For more details, please refer to the <a href="/racespage.html">RACES</a> page.</p>
