        <br>
        <br>
        <p>✧ Discord RP - We are a Discord-RP group. All RP will be over discord and most group activity will be there as well.</p>
        <p>✧ 18+ applicants only - This is a mature group that will deal with adult themes like violence and strong language. Please note that all characters should act and look 18+ as well.
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+Do not lie about your age.</p></p>
        <p>✧ No Traces/Bases/Disgraces - We're an art-heavy group, so apps must be drawn by you and bases/commissioned work is not allowed. Collaborated apps are fine, but you must have been the main artist.</p>
        <p>✧ No Special Snowflakes - Please stay away from playing overpowered characters and follow character creation guidelines.</p>
        <p>✧ Respect your fellow players - Everyone in the group is a person who deserves basic respect and courtesy. Remember that this is all fictional and for fun, so don't take things personally.
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+Character actions and thoughts =/= Player thoughts</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+If you don't agree with something their character did, calmly take it up with the player or consult a mod.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+Do not ever use someone's character in your rp unless with permission.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+We do not tolerate ANY sort of hate.</p>
        </p>
        <p>✧ No Godmodding - No invincible characters. No Godmodding other characters' actions. No ignoring other characters' actions.</p>
        <p>✧ No Metagaming - Your character should not be aware of everything that you as a player know.</p>
        <p>✧ Keep NSFW in proper channels - Try to keep anything 18+ in NSFW channels and private messages. This includes any sexual or violent content.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="poiret">RP</h3>
        <p>Rping on server is more lucrative, as well as recommended, however there are a few rules.</p>
        <p>✧ Try to reply to rps once every three days. If an rp has gone unreplied to for three days, others will be free to take that channel for another rp.</p>

        <h3 class="poiret">FAQ</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> ✦ Can I have more than one character?</p>
        <p>-Multiple characters will become available as the group progresses. At the start, however, you only have one.</p>
        <br>
        <p>✦ If I hate my character, can I kill them off and play a new one?</p>
        <p>-Yes, you can, but with discretion. Do not kill off a new character every week.</p>
        <br>
        <p> ✦ Can my character be rich/royalty etc. ?</p>
        <p>-Your character can be upper-class and privileged as long as they aren't major characters or high in power on a global scale.</p>
        <br>
        <p>✦ Can my character start with a pet at the beginning of the group?</p>
        <p>-No, because your character wouldn't have been allowed to bring one with them in the city. This can change with later characters who aren't prisoners, but the pet cannot be something too impractical.</p>
        <br>
        <p> ✦ Can my character have the curse mark on their armpit?</p>
        <p>-They can have their curse mark anywhere you like!</p>
        <br>
        <p>✦​ Do I have to read about all the regions and races?</p>
        <p>-No, but try to get at least somewhat familiar with the region and race you choose for your character.</p>
        <br>
        <p>✦ Pee Pee Chungus?</p>
        <p>-Yes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>✦​ My question wasn't answered.</p>
        <p>-Please drop us a message in the Discord server. We'll get back to you as soon as we can!</p>
