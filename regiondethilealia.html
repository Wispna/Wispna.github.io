                    <p><strong>Capital City:</strong> Kalze (Dethi) & Sercella (Lealia)</p>

                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Dethi and Lealia are two separate regions with a closely entwined history. The regions were once united as Dethi, before Lealia successfully split off and declared its own independence a few centuries ago. There is a continual feud between two robust family lineages in the regions, the Contagues and the Mapulets, which is generally a pain in the ass for everyone who has to deal with it (although the feud is a popular trope in outside regions and has spawned numerous romance novels - a famous play has even been written about it).
                      Marshes and grasslands make up most of Lealia’s geography, while Dethi is a marshy jungle. This region is the origin of the continent’s best tea, in numerous forms.</p>

                    <p><strong>Region Name:</strong> Dethi, The land of the dagger</p>
                    <p><strong>Capital/Notable Cities:</strong> Kalze: Set on the island in the center of the massive lake.</p>
                    <p><strong>Government Type:</strong> Monarchy -- the ruler of Dethi is a descendant from the noble family. This descendant is required to be a mage, and to cut their palm with a holy dagger that has been protected by the church of Dethi for centuries. The blood flows into a sacred pool that is located in the main church, and if the pool glows with an inner light, the descendant is believed to be chosen by the gods, and a worthy ruler of Dethi. </p>

                    <p><strong>How the rest of Tiranthe views them:</strong> Too involved in their own age old conflicts, and too small to ever be a threat. </p>
                    <p><strong>Issues this country faces:</strong> Loyalty, honor, fate, and tradition are considered key to being a good Dethi citizen. Those that go against this tradition may be ostracized or ridiculed, even if fighting for honor ends in gain for no one. </p>
                    <p>Regular skirmishes with Lealia.</p>
                    <p>If the carefully constructed levees fail and aren’t maintained by the government, Dethi could face significant flooding of much of their infrastructure. </p>
                    <p>Violent storms shake Dethi at certain times of year.</p>
                    <p><strong>What’s the economy like?:</strong> Not large, but not suffering.</p>
                    <p><strong>What are the main languages spoken?:</strong> Common, Xanthi</p>
                    <p><strong>Where do most people live?:</strong> At the edges of the lakes and rivers. Close enough to benefit from the rich, nutrient soil for farming, but far enough to not be flooded.</p>
                    <p><strong>How does this country view magic?:</strong> Magic is considered vaunted and honorable. Nobles that don’t have magical ability are considered lesser, and the one chosen as the ruler must be a talented mage. </p>
                    <p><strong>How technologically advanced is this country? Is magic preferred?:</strong> Technologically, they are behind many of the more powerful countries in Tiranthe. Magic is preferred.</p>
                    <p><strong>How is history recorded?:</strong> Through books and scrolls owned primarily by the wealthy.</p>
                    <p><strong>How many are educated, and how?:</strong> Most citizens of Dethi are taught rudimentary writing. Mages are given a good education in the magic schools dotted throughout Dethi.</p>
                    <p><strong>How did the majority of current people come to be on this land?:</strong> They lived here for generations, though a few washed up on shore, or traveled from neighboring countries.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why do people choose to live here?:</strong> The rich farmland, magical education, loyalty to Dethi.</p>
                    <p><strong>How popular is the government?:</strong> Popular. It is believed the chosen king/queen is one chosen by the gods themselves, and going against the government is incurring the wrath of the gods. </p>
                    <p><strong>How are criminals charged and punished?:</strong> Trials are given and are often unfair. Alternatively you may choose a trial by combat, or a trial by water in which you are left in a pool of water for a night, and if you survive, it is decided that the gods have deemed you innocent.</p>

                    <p><strong>What were major wars/disasters in the past?:</strong> The great flood-- a flood and storm that destroyed much of Dethi when an unworthy tyrant king was chosen to ascend the throne.</p>
                    <p>Long ago Dethi and Lealia were one, united as Dethi only, but then two rulers were deemed to be worthy, and those that backed one ruler or the other were split evenly across the land. This resulted in in-fighting that split the country, and soon half the country seceded entirely to become Lealia. </p>
                    <p><strong>Who are famous individuals?:</strong> Arthos: The tyrant king who bypassed the trial of the gods and ascended the throne without magic. It is said his rule caused the gods to flood Dethi in their anger.</p>
                    <p>Kivek and Tirza-- The two rulers of years past they were said to be deemed worthy simultaneously. Half the country thought Kivek was the true ruler, and the other half thought Tirza was. Those that followed Kivek stayed in Dethi, and those that followed Tirza seceded to become Lealia. </p>

                    <p>Dry years that cause horrible drought and famine, and limited farmland in general.</p>
                    <p><strong>What’s the economy like?:</strong> Not large. There is great economic disparity, and not many that belong to the middle class.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What are the main languages spoken?:</strong> Common, Xanthi</p>
                    <p><strong>Where do most people live?:</strong> Near to the south of Lealia and the river, where the desert heat is not as scalding. </p>

                    <p><strong>How many are educated, and how?:</strong> Mainly the nobles of Lealia are given an education. Occasionally poorer mages are adopted into noble family so that they may receive a magical tutorship that a mage is expected to receive from their noble family.</p>
                    <p><strong>How did the majority of current people come to be on this land?:</strong> Most lived here for generations, though some came to Lealia from neighboring countries. </p>
                    <p><strong>Why do people choose to live here?:</strong> Loyalty to the country. Lealia is also an escape from the harsh dangers of Triem Sha, and the wealthy live in luxury. </p>
                    <p><strong>How popular is the government?:</strong> Not necessarily popular among the poor due to disparity in wealth, but since it is believed the ruler was chosen by the gods, they feel there is little they can do. </p>
                    <p><strong>How are criminals charged and punished?:</strong> Trials are given and are often unfair. Alternatively you may choose a trial by combat, or a trial by fire in which you are told to cross a burning pit. If you manage to do so and remain unscathed, it is believed the gods have deemed you innocent. </p>

                    <p><strong>What were major wars/disasters in the past?:</strong> The great flood-- a flood and storm that destroyed much of Dethi when an unworthy tyrant king was chosen to ascend the throne.</p>
                    <p>Long ago Dethi and Lealia were one, united as Dethi only, but then two rulers were deemed to be worthy, and those that backed one ruler or the other were split evenly across the land. This resulted in in-fighting that split the country, and soon half the country seceded entirely to become Lealia. </p>
                    <p><strong>Who are famous individuals?:</strong>Arthos: The tyrant king who bypassed the trial of the gods and ascended the throne without magic. It is said his rule caused the gods to flood Dethi in their anger. </p>
                    <p>Kivek and Tirza-- The two rulers of years past they were said to be deemed worthy simultaneously. Half the country thought Kivek was the true ruler, and the other half thought Tirza was. Those that followed Kivek stayed in Dethi, and those that followed Tirza seceded to become Lealia. </p>
