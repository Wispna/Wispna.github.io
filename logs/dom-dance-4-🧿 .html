The ballroom is resplendent, glowing with magical light, and lined with tall windows that show the glimmering stars, and the city of Myrenn below that glimmers in turn as if it&#39;s a mirror reflecting the sky.

The room is circular in shape, and two staircases twine along the walls that lead to a balcony on the second level that overlooks the dance floor below. Here partygoers can socialize and eat rather than dance. The tables here are laden with luxurious Myrenn delicacies, and have enough variety to satisfy any palate. 

Doors on this second level lead to outdoor balconies that are laden with plants and flowers to grant some privacy, and are a place away from the noise and chaos of the party inside.

The dancefloor below is on a polished stone floor. A raised seat on one end where the queen may sit is on the end opposite the entryway, and on either side is a raised stage where well dressed bards play music. 

The dancers all look to be wealthy, and they glide across the floor, their footsteps soft and rhythmic against the floor. Most are dressed in silver or gray, and many seem to have a dyed lock of hair. They regard the arrivals with curiosity, uncertain of what to think of these strangers that were escorted by members of the queensguard.

Stonehawk introduces the cursed as heroes of Myrenn, and curiosity only grows.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 5, 2024 1:20 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Crowds of souls adorned in jewels and luxuries would swarmed Myrenn’s place doors. All of them awaiting, to join in on the <em>Dance of Mirrors</em>.

Was it an inclusive event? Or was it the announcement that the <em>Marked</em> would be attending that caused such an uproar over this event.

Whose to say, Certainly this Xanthi in particular could only surmise the story that led to this fateful evening. But, just as all her theorized stories before, <em>hers</em> was probably the more <em>amusing</em> version.

Morgana would linger just steps behind the <em>Marked</em> citizens. Separating herself from their grand entrance and the <em>attention</em> it drew. She didn’t need an announced spot light. Surely, just like events in the past, her towering frame alone was enough to pull a rooms attention. And as of right now, such attention isn’t what she yearned. Instead, she would remain concealed within the shadows of the balcony. Her frostbitten Irises veiled by star riddled fabric as she glanced at the crowd below. Watching, <em>examining</em> the rooms expressions as the Cursed descended their way into the room. And as expected, there was a cacophony of reactions that painted themselves on the partygoers faces. Distain and Curiosity were to be expected. Though those, weren’t the expressions Morgana was searching for, no, her gaze would search for those with neutral glances. Ones who bare <em>no</em> reaction. For typically, those were the ones that bore masks to conceal their true nature. And those, she found <em>quite</em> interesting.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1214004847485911080 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1214004847485911080><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 3, 2024 5:21 PM">5:21 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>•
As the Cursed finally reached the ground floor, that would be Morgana’s cue to finally emerge from the shadows. She herself, adorning loose fabrics of midnight blue would descend the stair case. Intertwining herself back within the crowd of Cursed.

Now that she’s here….however does she begin her night?

Just as such a question crossed her mind, a dim glint of <em>green</em> would pull her attention. And the unknown face it resided with, would pull her curiosity even further. Especially, when her mineral senses seemed to spark ablaze by merely gazing in their direction. A familiar reaction she had…when she first laid her eyes on dear Elysia.

“My…” The Xanthi would breathe a small sigh as she took her place next to the, <em>peculiar</em> soul. “Who could have guessed that a Dance of all things would reveal the unknown faces of Raehn.” Her gaze would shift beneath her veil as she stared down at the other. Her thoughts taking note of their peculiar features now that she was close. The carefully placed stitching. The steel that laid clasped along their neck line, the construct of their skin…Just how <em>similar</em> to Elysia was this stranger, she wondered.

“You yourself, being one of those unfortunate unknowns.” A large paw would extend towards the man, along with a gentle smile in tow. “Might you entertain me this evening, by sharing your name?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was something unnatural about the way they were all to arrive to the affair together even introduced as <em>heroes</em>. Rather, the more he thinks on the matter, the more strange it seems to be referred to as a hero. What heroic deed was there that those around him had accomplished? Well, he was mostly unaware of past happenings and even of a majority of the individuals around him. Even as he had settled in Raehn, he had kept mostly to himself in an act of timid recluse. It was more in fear of himself than in fear of others. But perhaps the vague announcement of heroes meant someone amongst them really <em>was</em> a valiant being and he knows that it surely is not him. If such a person existed, he&#39;d like to know them...

How he finds himself in the <em>Dance of Mirrors</em> is a mystery. Whipstitch attributes his presence as being swept in by the tide--an activity he had no choice in but somehow by chance ended up in. Or could it be that there was a sense of romanticism that came with these kinds of affairs. He had only heard of balls in faraway stories, told to him in a hushed voice longing and aching to go to one; distant now the memories of the voice humming a waltz as they grasped his hand and lead him to dance. Of glittering lights and glittering eyes accompanied by the faint clicking of a heel and the warmth of two halves of hearts swaying as one on pristine floors. He remembers scrawled meticulously atop parchment, a dress of dreams, flowing, extravagant, and to complement it, the clothes he wore now. He cannot attribute the hours he sat with needle and thread, rather than accepting clothes provided to them, to pure coincidence. The burning sensation of fulfilling a promise of long ago blazes hot and yet he wonders how he had gotten here.

The dancers who had already been in the ballroom before</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1214013582740688967 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1214013582740688967><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 3, 2024 5:56 PM">5:56 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>his group&#39;s arrival were a clear display of decadence and he feels that his appearance pales in comparison. Thinking it foolish that he was here in the first place, maybe it would be good to blend in with the others and play in the shadows. Oh..but oh...! How could someone as ugly and as drab as him be someone who could blend in? Blend in with what? With GARBAGE? Oh, how he wants to melt away into nothingness. Maybe he should leave.

Playing a tug-of-war with himself and his own self worth, Whipstitch hesitates on even staying any longer until a foreboding presence lingers near him. Imposing is the woman next to him, large in stature and yet she seemed delicate and graceful but still elegant and poised. He is not used to seeing Xanthi even though there were many of them in Raehn. His maker was a human and the people he&#39;d observed from behind locked glass were also human. He supposes he had met Feroxi before but even then they were mostly human in appearance. There&#39;s an allure to the unknown, though, and he finds himself curious until the cadence of her voice pulls him out of his thoughts and he flinches slightly in surprise. 

Glancing from side to side, Whipstitch wonders if she&#39;s talking to him. Surely not, right? He was trying so very hard to make himself small...to fit in with the walls...he must be so <em>damned</em>, so <em>wretched</em>, so <em>ugly</em> that she could not even ignore his pathetically lame person standing there dumbly. If he ignores her, it would be awkward and rude if she truly was talking to him. But if he responds and finds that she was talking to someone BESIDE him? EMBARRASSING. SHAMEFUL EVEN.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1214013600478531604 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1214013600478531604><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 3, 2024 5:56 PM">5:56 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Her extended paw is more than enough of an answer to his inner turmoil. With shaking pupils, he turns to her fully. He tries not to stare but he thinks that even her smile is enchanting but also scary in its unfamiliarity. It&#39;s within his nature not to refuse when someone is talking to him. He opens his mouth for a moment but closes it again, reconsidering the script he has constructed for himself in the split second of their interaction. The extension of his hand in return is drawn out, looking both nonchalant but also extremely hesitant. 

&quot;My name? It is Whipstitch...ᵇᵘᵗ ʸᵒᵘ ᶜᵃⁿ ᵃˡˢᵒ ʳᵉᶠᵉʳ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ ᵃˢ ⁿᵒᵗʰᶦⁿᵍ ᵃᵗ ᵃˡˡ, ᵗᵒᵒ, ᵐᶦˢˢ...&quot; The last part is mumbled very quietly and quickly. He swallows and shakes his head mentally before softly returning her smile. There&#39;s a slight twitch in the corner of his lips from nervousness.

&quot;And who do I owe the pleasure?&quot; He sounds dumb as hell. He wants to jump off the balcony right now.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For she was a lady of patience after all. And she’s always known that good things come to those who wait. 

“Whipstitch…” She’d lull their name like a soothing lullaby. “Why…I think such a name is certainly more fitting than nothing at all.” Even when the man tried to retreat his words into the shadows, Morgana would make sure to bring them right back to the light. Though, she wouldn’t do so without a touch of reassurance. 

Just as those words had escaped her lips, Morgana would softly take hold of the others hand. Raven plush fur brushing against what was akin to skin but, she knew other wise. A fascination she would quite enjoy divulging in further but, alas, she would push it aside for now. As the man has revealed something far more <em>entertaining</em> in the meantime. And that something was…

✨Self-Doubt✨

“…if you were nothing, Dear Whipstitch—“ Morgana’s smile would warm as she clasped the man’s hand between both of her own. “My hands would have nothing to hold onto, <em>now would they</em>?” Her last words whispered like a silly secret as she gave a small pat to the mans hand. Reassuring her words even further with a simple touch.

“So you hold onto that name of yours. Don’t give another the chance to degrade you to mere nothing.” Another pat would be made to the back of his hand before she’d release him fully from her grasp. Returning Whipstitch’s personal space.

“As for me, why, you may call me Morgana.” Her head would dip into a small bow of greeting.

“Though, while we linger on the topic of names… why, I must apologize for my curiosity, for it nips at me to ask…how ever were given such a unique name? Is that a story you are open to share?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His face fixed in a current position of an almost <em>too</em> courteous smile that doesn&#39;t quite reach his eyes, he feels himself whisked away by the smoothness of her voice. The words falling from her mouth like trickles of water feel like pricks of ice against his skin as he feels nervousness settle in on top of curiosity but feels it even so when she seems to hold in there in her hands. Surely she&#39;s not  holding him captive there and her hold on him is anything but threatening but he feels her gaze on him like predator to prey. Another thing he was not used to: someone towering over him,

He laughs softly, though nervously, at her comment, thinking it rude to take his hand away and instead lets her hold them. He&#39;s used to letting someone take the lead of the conversation like this and only follows what he should do, letting himself be taken by the pace of the conversation. His smile drops back to a neutral expression. Another time someone has made such a comment and yet he had thought he had he&#39;d said his own name with more conviction (<s>he was delusional</s>). 

&quot;There&#39;s nothing to degrade, I am just a lowly little thing just trying to get by...&quot; He&#39;s mumbling again. That&#39;s the way he was taught after all! He was just there to be of use! To be a nice little doll atop someone&#39;s shelf only to be taken down when they needed something to toy with, to use, to berate. It was too hard when he spent all of his existence having this mindset hammered into him along with every gear and fastener. 

When at last his personal bubble is returned, he steps back slightly, putting a miniscule amount of distance between them. It seemed that the stranger&#39;s actions and musings had no ill intention but he still felt things were a little off. Was he always so doubtful of others? Maybe he shouldn&#39;t be so judgmental.

&quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you, Miss Morgan</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1214053375885443112 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1214053375885443112><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 3, 2024 8:34 PM">8:34 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>a,&quot; Whipstitch&#39;s tone is flat but neutral. He had copied the usage of formalities from his time meeting Asher, Cendrillion, and Ayame. They seemed to be pretty fond of using titles and it seemed very reasonable and pleasant to follow suit. He nods slightly as a bow, the inner flesh of his neck dipping to become more visible. One would realize that rather than a pool of flesh within, hard, shining red stone as smooth as marble lay. Morgana&#39;s question is to be expected though he&#39;s surprised no one had asked him about this sooner. He considers it for a second and then smiles again, the same polite smile before he chuckles softly. It was a good time to show that he was proud of this name he&#39;d chosen for himself.

&quot;Have you ever sewn before?&quot; His hands motion in a reenactment of needle, thread, and cloth. His visible hand that holds an invisible needle is raised to his face, where the distinct markings that seal the separation marks of his facial frame lay and touch one stitch softly. &quot;This kind of stitch is called a <em>whipstitch</em>. One of the first stitches you will learn if you come to learn the skill,&quot; 

His pinched finger moves ever so slightly on his cheek as if he&#39;s pulling a needle out of the other end, imitating the way it would be done. &quot;Simple and clean. But it is a nice little stitch that joins two things together,&quot; He finger drags to tap his head and the glint of green twinkles from behind the glass orbs of his eyes. &quot;And I think I am a creature that is similar to that.&quot;

His hand to his sides before he folds them behind his back, holding the steel rod wrist of his other arm, concealed by a long dangling sleeve. &quot;Miss Morgana, do I get a story in return?&quot; The question is innocent with no intention of being sly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He himself turning the pages of his own story with the faint movements he portrayed.

The forced smile, like an invisible being was pulling at the corners of his mouth. The first cue to discomfort. Was he a shy one perhaps? On top of the self belittling?

Then there was the quivered laugh, one as if forced out in a moment of unease. This one perhaps born from a sense of displacement, or uncertainty on how to respond. Was the cause from her questioning? Or is it perhaps the lively venue?

 And finally, the cherry on top of it all, the step back into one’s comfort zone. That was certainly her doing. One she will make sure to keep note of if she wishes to keep the other talking. 

Comfort is key. Something she thought she was failing at for a moment until the topic of <em>stitching</em> brought on a certain <em>sparkle</em> to the mans eye.

“Sewing? Why, I have tried my hand once or twice—“ Then, even before the man got to explain, it was like a lightbulb had gone off in her mind. Her own expression relaying just that as she raised a hand to stifle the surprised gasp that parted her lips.

It was the TYPE of stitching! The kind he wore right on his face! Goodness how on earth did she let that slip by when the reasoning was quite literally in front of her? She felt a bit ashamed honestly. Though, such shameful feelings would swiftly be swept under the rug. Especially given the mans eagerness to demonstrate. A demonstration, that earned a soft clap on her part once it was finished.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1214098293710262282 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1214098293710262282><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 3, 2024 11:33 PM">11:33 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>•
“Goodness, how clever of a name that certainly is!” She’d lean forward ever so slightly to admire the stitch work. Still leaving plenty of room as to not invade Whipstitch’s space. Though, as she leaned, her gaze couldn’t help but drift towards the green glint that twinkled behind his eyes. Her curiosity igniting once more. But, she would relent yet again. Not wishing to frighten the poor lamb just yet.

“One etched into your very own canvas. My, what a marvel. And unique! In more way than one 
now.” With her spurt of excitement quelled, Morgana would return to her straightened posture. A small nod following suit towards Whipstitch’s next question.

“I suppose it would only be courteous. A story for a story. Though…” Her smile would soften as she brought a hand to cup her own cheek.

In fact, he&#39;s too busy trying to figure out what&#39;s going on with <em>her</em>. He got by most of his interactions feeling out what the other person wanted but he wasn&#39;t sure what it was that Morgana wanted. Perhaps she really did just want to have a nice little conversation with him. Do people so easily try to get to know others? His experience was lacking but it seemed where he had little, she had an abundance. 

He loses these thoughts while explaining to her the concept of his name--something he&#39;d fashioned for himself quite recently and had grown attached to despite all of his previous interactions where he showed anything but. While he had been overly self-conscious previously and on high alert, his guard had loosened now and he concludes that Morgana seemed to be nice enough so far. Aside from her...ahem...lack of personal distance, she had never said anything untoward him and in fact has said mostly nice things. He has deemed her to be a very kind woman, indeed. (He is easy to please).

His eyes brighten when Morgana mentions that she has sewn before. It&#39;s not that uncommon of a hobby, so he&#39;s told, but it is something he has grown an affinity to over the years. It is an excellent topic of discussion should he need to revisit it later. A line for his mental list--

A sheepish smile fights with the sudden triumphant puff to his chest out of confidence. A <em>clever</em> name..! He&#39;s heard suitable and even wonderful but never clever..! That implies that he&#39;s...! Intelligent! Morgana&#39;s onslaught of what Whipstitch interprets as high praise makes him even more proud--just proud enough that the wall he has built up in their brief encounter has completely crumbled. He was a simple man, really. A simple man weak to praise.

Tilting his head curiously, he finds himself leaning forward too, eager for Morgana&#39;s story in exchange.

TWO STORIES? What a deal! For only one of his? (<s>He definitely already offered one earlier, granted math was not his strong suit</s>). What magnificent life could the woman lead to have not only ONE story available to tell but TWO WHOLE STORIES. Amazing! He wanted to hear more. 

Before he can think rationally about divulging his whole life&#39;s tale, he&#39;s nodding fervently in agreement. <img

Surely they&#39;re not drawing too much attention. But he supposes that they <em>are * standing around when others are supposed to be dancing. How rude of him...!

Pursing his lips, Whipstitch is unsure of what it is that Morgana wants to do. If she is the one to bring up their current position, then it must mean she is politely suggesting that they move elsewhere without saying so. ...Right? Or could it be that she is feeling such an intense sense of boredom talking to Whipstitch that she needs to keep her feet active in order to not drop to her feet in the monotony of his voice? 

The choice was all his but he knows that when a lady makes such a suggestion they have an answer that they want to hear. Morgana had seemed like such a confident individual that Whipstitch thought surely she&#39;d not care about such things but he guesses that *even she</em> possesses the same sensibilities as even the most timid young woman. 

He won&#39;t let her down. After all! Don&#39;t people come to balls for one thing? (Well aside from other nuances but Whipstitch does not have the pleasure of knowing much more than that). 

 A hand is extended by him this time, before his other arm crosses his chest in a bow. &quot;Then would you tell me your stories over a dance? Or would that be too distracting to you?&quot; 

His answer is contrary to what Morgana has expected. In fact, it&#39;s possible no one had expected someone like Whipstitch to have experience dancing at all <img

“On the contrary-“ Her paw would extend yet again. Only to accept the mans gesture by placing her palm upon his. 

“—I am quite comfortable in the art of multitasking.” A small chuckle would bubble from her lips. “Now, where do I begin…ah yes…we were on the topic of names.” A small <em>purr</em> like hum would resonate from the woman as she pondered just how to start this little tale of hers.

“I am not sure how well acquainted you are with Xanthi culture, but with the more traditional families of my species, one does not give their child a name the moment they are born. No, instead, that child is meant to <em>earn</em> their name. A name, spelt with blood.” With a gentle smile Morgana would settle into dancing position. Her free arm reaching to sit comfortably upon Whipstitch’s shoulder.

“Your first kill is forever idolized as it takes its place within a Xanthi’s name. As well as the weapon you used to commit the deed. Claw weasel, Scythe Serpent, Mace Kudu, the list goes on for centuries.”  A soft sigh would shift her figure as she tried to remember all the names from her own village.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1214518685016920124 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1214518685016920124><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 5, 2024 3:23 AM">3:23 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>•
“One can even find my own family tree, etched within the lines of that archaic list.” Her smile and expression would remain neutral as she spoke. Not wishing to give away the ending of her story too much before the reveal~ Where would be the fun in that!

“Which brings us to the next chapter of my story. How this tradition ties in with the name I have given you.”  It would be here that her smile widens just a hint. Gaze locked onto the Golem like a cat ready to pounce on its prey.

“Is Morgana the weapon? Or the kill?” She’d let an air of silence draw further attention onto her question before continuing on.

“Do you have any guesses before I make the reveal?…<em>and don’t forget to move your feet~</em>” She’d whisper with a small chuckle.  “This still is a dance after all.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The same voice who had told stories of extravagant balls and flooded his memory with intricate dress was the same body who had taken his hand gentle and guided it to her waist. She had taught him to lead and to follow, where to step and the pace of it all. He had danced many times with her. A distantly faint memory, but vivid now the longer they stand there. He had wondered how long it had been since he had danced.

The feeling is bittersweet that his partner now on the ballroom floor was not a person who he had always envisioned himself being here but with a stranger. Things were different now. It was time to accept it.

Whipstitch tilts his head slightly, a gesture meaning no...he was <em>not</em> familiar with Xanthi culture. He finds the idea of being born--being born into a family even, to be fascinating and foreign. The concept of tradition and upholding it; these were not things he had known but knew existed. As Morgana begins her story, he begins to think that they are quite similar despite their upbringing differing. He had earned and made a name for himself too and he was not born with one. His thoughts are interrupted at the mention of blood.

Letting Morgana speak, Whipstitch finds the small of her back, albeit awkwardly considering their difference in height. He&#39;s glad that they are in the positions she has set for them because otherwise it would be quite a strange, disjointed reach for Morgana. Whipstitch wouldn&#39;t want her to dislocate her shoulder, after all. Though, if their positions <em>were</em> switched and Morgana&#39;s hands were where his are now, she would find that just a little lower down from here the small of his back was would be nothing at all. Fabric pulled taught to give the illusion of solidity underneath and yet it was a void. Another curiosity of his person that was yet to be discovered by her but perhaps for another time. What she <em>can</em> discover in</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1214978687905038376 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1214978687905038376><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 6, 2024 9:51 AM">9:51 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>their now close proximity is a faint noise like the ticking of a clock--or could it be multiple?--constantly whirring and clicking like a timebomb waiting to explode. It was steady and rhythmic with the cadence of of a bassline resting deep below the noise above, just enough to permeate the barrier of sound like a faint breath. His own purr of sorts though not one he could control. And on her back, something round and cold underneath silky white fabric where a warm hand should be. 

Her smile was unsettling now and she once again felt imposing and larger than life. Had he put himself in a trap? Na&#239;ve and innocently played right into her hands? Whipstitch shakes the thought away, scolding himself mentally for thinking such things. He had already decided that Morgana was good person even if she had to kill someone for her name <img

He had found himself so hung up on the riveting details of her gruesome history that he had become still. Engrossed in her words, he blinks, realizing that he had not been moving much at all when she reminds him. Whipstitch clears his empty throat, the hollowness echoing in his frame as the sound forces itself down and he brings himself to meet her eyes again.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1214978699523526716 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1214978699523526716><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 6, 2024 9:51 AM">9:51 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Is it from the weapon?

This whole thing was a little too much for him; a bit too scary. But still, there&#39;s a morbid curiosity to find out the end.

When he&#39;s finally gotten his guess out, he resumes his step and finds it still to be muscle memory. <em>Step, step step</em>. There was no flamboyant flair to his dancing but it was precise and confident. It was clear he had danced before many times. 

&quot;Miss Morgana, may I ask: what happens if you do not follow the tradition? What then?&quot; He was dying to know. It was a question among questions he could not contain this time.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=GRRGRGRR><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=GRRGRGRR src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1170674573344256012.gif loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=two_hearts><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=💕 src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/1f495.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Fabrics of midnight blue billowing behind her with each synchronized movement of their frames. Even with no additional flare, the pair would look as if the Night Sky had descended onto the dance floor. One adorned in starlight, and the other, the void that surrounds it.

“My, how I do so enjoy the way you think, Sir Whipstitch.” Her smile would deepen at his preference of name. Or rather the meaning behind his decision. “But alas, It seems time I inform you that my question, was but a red herring from the start. A <em>trick</em> if you will.” She’d add the clarification just incase the man was not familiar with the phrase.

“For my name is not of weapon, <em>nor</em> of prey.” The story would roll off her tongue with ease. “In fact, my name was crafted, much like yours. One born from my own design. Which, I suppose, is the perfect lead into your following question.” Yet another chuckle would shift her frame. Delighted to see her silly tales have captured the attention of this interesting soul.

“Since I refused to shed blood in the name of tradition, I was deemed a betrayer in the eyes of my tribe.” A sickly sweet smile would remain ever present upon the Xanthi’s lips. Almost as if she took pride in this tale of hers.

“<em>Nothing</em>  they would call me. Or at least, if they were forced to speak to me at all, that is the title they would address me by.” Even with the somber tale, Morgana would not miss a single step. Her stature remaining as proud as ever whilst gliding in the steps crafted by the Golem’s lead. 

“Now I cannot speak for every tribe, but it would not surprise me if more followed in the footsteps of my own. Reducing supposed ‘tradition breakers’ to mere nothings.” A practiced <em>scoff</em> would escape her. “Though I have heard the newer generations are forgoing such traditions entirely. Quite the shame none shared the same plains as mine.”</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=LOOKING><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=LOOKING src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/665664830526586897.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

A sense of relief somehow washes over him when Morgana reveals the real answer. There was a part of him that had hoped this would be the case. There was solace in the fact that Morgana was not (at least for now) a ruthless killer. He finds that there&#39;s a smile on his face before he softly laughs too, her own snickering becoming contagious.

&quot;We&#39;re alike, after all,&quot; He says between a delighted sigh. He verbalizes this thought rather than keeping it in from before and somehow saying it out loud makes it feel more real, like they are connected in a way. &quot;Perhaps this is what they mean by a dance of <em>mirrors</em>...!&quot; His voice is lilted now, much different in attitude than their first exchange of words.

Morgana was more upstanding than he thought and Whipstitch can&#39;t help but admire her and her own courageousness. To go against tradition and follow her own ideals and heart--that was the type of person he aspired to be. Whom he <em>wanted</em> to be in this moment. It was a stroke of luck that they had met today. Where else would he have met such an inspiring figure? He understands now why some of the Marked were referred to as heroes. But now there was the nagging feeling that his previous misjudgment of Morgana said more about his own mentality that would need to be rewired and reworked. He had wondered when he had become so close-minded.

&quot;How amazing..! I think you are truly commendable for following through with taking such a noble action. My respect for you has deepened, Miss Morgana,&quot; He pours more and more praise towards her than this, falling from his cold lips like a waterfall. There was a reason for her pride and for her poise and she had every right to express it. But then, his face drops ever so slightly until it darkens altogether. A profound sadness hangs heavy over Whipstitch&#39;s head, weighing him down and he slumps a little (though not enough to make their dance ha</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1215343221341683742 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1215343221341683742><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 7, 2024 10:00 AM">10:00 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>lt). 

&quot;But Miss Morgana, isn&#39;t it so lonely? You had to leave everyone behind...your family and your tribe....Everything you knew. And now you are by yourself,&quot; Big tears begin to well up in the corners of his eyes, abnormally large and filled with a clear liquid too think to be water. He sniffles only lightly, a poor attempt to hold back the tears.

Morgana’s expression would warm further. A pleased smile shaping her lips as she took in the mans lowered guard like a breathe of fresh air. But, what precisely was it that made him ease? She pondered the question. Thinking back on her little tale.

Was the answer as simple as unspilt blood? The camaraderie of sharing one’s beginnings? Or was there something more that enticed the golem from their shell?

Her steps would remain in sync with the mans even when her mind drifted elsewhere. Only to be reeled back like a moth to a flame when he revealed the answer she so desired.

<em>Shared kinship</em>

She’d mull the idea in her mind. Saturating it into her thoughts as the man continued on. This seemed like the obvious answer as it slipped from his very own lips but, he’s fooled her twice already. And she wasn’t about to let there be a third.

“Oh come now, you are much too kind! There is no need for such high praise. You have only just met me!” She’d lift a hand as if to fan away Whipstitch’s words. A coy smile feigning her lips before she settled back into their dance. Only to lean forward  and whisper— “<em>Though I’d be quite the fibber if I didn’t admit, such a comment has made my evening</em>.” A giddy chuckle would ruffle her fur before she stood upright once more. Though their gleeful moment would take a turn, as a clear liquid began to glass over the others gaze.

“Oh dearie…Simple, and Clean Whipstitch.” Her expression would soften as she broke waltz form to cup the weeping man’s cheek. Her thumb trailing the damp liquid that threatened to spill.

“Are these tears for me?” Her question would be laced in concerned.

“Or do they spill…because those are questions you’ve once asked yourself?” Another tap against his mental door to let her in.

“Perhaps back then my wounds ran deep.” Her thumb would drift from the artificial tears. Only to trace the stitch line that decorated the golems cheek. “But over the years, I found solace in <em>others</em> to stitch my wounds closed. The comfort they brought acting as the string that pulled the wound close.” Her inner thoughts shuddered speaking such words but she’d continue on. Her touch delicate as it descended the golems seam. 

“The scar may forever be present but, with each passing year, with each added <em>stitch</em>…it becomes more bearable to endure.” Her words would draw to a momentary lull. 

“Do you feel Alone, Whipstitch? ”

Whipstitch knew that those who were deserving of high praise never accepted it easily and would always downplay the grandeur of their actions. Morgana wa no different. So it makes him swell up with warmth when she expresses that such compliments have made her evening. He wasn&#39;t useless after all and he was even being a <em>great</em> conversation partner! He wasn&#39;t messing this up!

Of course, that feeling is short-lived now that he is on the verge of bawling his eyes out in the middle of the dancefloor like some child. He feels even worse now that they&#39;d stop their dancing to address his shameful action and even worse that Morgana is bringing <em>attention</em> to it, too. Her touch is soft and Whipstitch resists the instinct to lean into her hand; he did not know her and showing such weakness was pitiful and most likely disturbing for the other party. Instead he lets her grasp his face, her hands plush and much different than the small and cold hands that would do this very action before. Any moment that Morgana&#39;s hands so much as move even a millimeter, he flinches slightly, shaking and awaiting the pain that comes next.

But it doesn&#39;t come.

&quot;I&#39;m very sorry for my sudden display,&quot; Fake breath hitches and he averts his eyes, the thick liquid sticking to his eyelashes and taking its time to trickle down his cheek. &quot;It&#39;s just that thinking that someone as dignified as you to come from a place of loneliness and hurt is heartbreaking to me...&quot;

Again he falls silent at her question, his silence giving her exactly the answer that she is thinking. He had never thought about if his tears for others were for himself at the core. He found himself to be extremely empathetic and to bring someone else&#39;s hardship back to himself seemed selfish, unthinkable. There was no way that his sadness stemmed from his own experience other than that he could relate deeply to the feeling of profound loneliness.

He freezes feeling her finger run across the seams on his face. He&#39;s sure that she can feel the way that his hands tremble and his closes his eyes tight just in case she suddenly becomes angry with him. Was his pity uncalled for? Had he been improper to ask such things of a woman whom he only met today? If she decided to strike him for his impudence, he&#39;d deserve it. But instead she continues to display how much of an elevated person she was--unphased by her past and instead rising above it and coming to terms with it. He still had a long way to go when it came to his shortcomings.

Clearing his throat, he finds the strength in him to remove her hands and distance himself with a step back from Morgana. While wiping his tears with his sleeves, he then gestures for the two of them to move off the dance floor to continue their chat elsewhere. Of course, giving Morgana the chance to leave. 

&quot;I&#39;m relieved to hear that you&#39;ve found a new family, of sorts. It sounds like such a presence has made life worth living for you,&quot; He&#39;s made an assumption there. Again, his robotic smile returns and just as quickly as he&#39;s let his guard down for Morgana, it seems he has built the wall back up. His eyes linger towards a horizon line nowhere in particular.

&quot;<em>Things</em> like me do not deserve to feel loneliness, Miss Morgana.&quot; He blinks a little too slowly to be natural, &quot;Thank you for telling me the origins of your name. It feels like an honor to listen to such a tale. I believe I owe you another story now, so please let me know what you&#39;d like to know...&quot; He tries to keep his tone neutral but it comes out flat, distant in tone that could only signify that something she said had offended him.

The door so slightly cracked and yet, a brick walled prevented her from going any further. 

<em>’Was it always there?’</em> she wondered. The door allowed to open but a crack, but never further. She couldn’t help but ponder if she was the cause, or if this was an ingrained action. One where the desire to let someone in was there. But, when they get too close to actually peering inside, they shut them back out just as quick. 

From the way their hands shook at her touch, she had a hunch these seams held together much deeper wounds than mere aesthetics. Her own hands <em>itching</em> to learn the cause. But, patience is key. She need remember.

As the man gestures for them to leave the dance floor, she would agree, and follow after she’d given the proper <em>curtsey</em> to signify the end of their waltz. Wouldn’t want to make this little scene stand out more than it already has, now would she?

As they neared the edge of the room, Morgana would locate the nearest two chairs. Commanding them forth with the use of her magic. Making sure there was ample distance between them before claiming one of the seats as her own. Perhaps being on the same level as the other would bring a sense of ease. One that her towering frame has a habit of tarnishing.

“Let me ask this first,” She gestures for him to take a seat if he so pleases.

“What <em>can</em> I ask?” She stares at the man a good long while. Her own expression losing the warmth it once bore for that of thoughtful brows.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1216907249390452867 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1216907249390452867><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 11, 2024 6:34 PM">6:34 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>•
“I must deter…and apologize if my actions or words have upset you in anyway.” Her hand would lift to press against her own chest. A sign of empathy she has come to learn. “If it is my touch, I shall keep it to myself. I know I have quite the habit of… ‘sprucing’ up my story tellings with the use of them.” What can she say, she’s an animated talker.

“But if it is not that, if you could, do tell me if what I do upsets you.” From how the mans demeanor flipped like a switch, it wasn’t hard to see that perhaps it was her own doings that caused such a change. Thought the reasoning was unclear.

“We all are <em>living</em> things here. This includes you and I.” Her mothering demeanor would start to seep through and take over. Hands clasped within her lap as she sought an understanding with the golem. “And with that title, we gain the rights to expression and usage of emotions. Sure some are less pleasant then others but, we cannot help it. For it comes with the package of life.” She knew she was treading dangerous waters here but, with their usage of ‘<em>Things</em>’, she felt it was a necessary one.

“So again, do tell me, what are <em>comfortable</em> questions, I may ask. Or…as to not put you in the spotlight, how about, if I gave an array of questions? Then you merely pick out which you prefer to answer. How does that sound?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He wonders what else she is capable of if she is mentally and socially strong but also seems to have an aptitude for magic. Again, he is ignorant to how the beings in this world function (and has never questioned or wondered of his own existence). Do Xanthi usually have magic? If so, where does it come from? He&#39;d never had the opportunity to learn these things. There&#39;s a moment of pause as he thinks if it&#39;s okay to sit down, as if being called forth with magic had done something to the chair. The fear even crossed his mind that if he sat there, he&#39;d never come out. That was only a foolish thought and he shakes it out just as quickly as it appears.

He sucks in his cheek as he considers the question. What is okay to ask? He&#39;s never been asked what would be okay with him. He&#39;d always done as he was asked and answered when spoken to. He didn&#39;t have any say or choice to object and very rarely did he find the need to. It was only recently he had pulled up some sort of resistance in him...Before he can answer, Morgana continues and he sinks into the chair a little. 

Did he seem upset? It was very clear to everyone else that his mood had been dampened greatly in their last conversation but he seemed to be the only one unaware of the shift. He had believed himself to be a master at masking how he felt but it seemed that was not the case. His only example of who to follow always made it clear what they were feeling and the nuances of human emotions were that of drama--always showing on her face or through her body language and he&#39;d unknowingly adopted the habit. 

&quot;You have not upset me,&quot; Now that he has to say it out loud, it does feel like he&#39;s been quite the drama queen. He&#39;d have to reflect on the way he portrayed his emotions if others are apologizing to him when they&#39;ve done no wrong. He was not cut out yet to socialize and it was clear to him that he is always lacki</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1217230845442523210 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1217230845442523210><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 12, 2024 4:00 PM">4:00 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>ng, always five steps behind. He needs to learn. There is a pause that is long and drawn out before he continues, &quot;You could say that I&#39;m just unacquainted with...&quot; what would be the right word here? &quot;Socializing, you see. I haven&#39;t been out in a long time...&quot; 

He needn&#39;t divulge the details further.

Once more Morgana takes on a nurturing tone and while to others it may seem overbearing to be lectured on the value of a life, Whipstitch absorbs every word and accepts them whole-heartedly. He greatly appreciates the woman&#39;s patience with him despite his insufficiency and the words lay heavy on his shoulders. Things to be evaluated later on his list that stretches miles long of how to improve himself to become more humane.

Whipstitch doesn&#39;t protest or so much as say anything. Instead he nods, head hung low like a child being scolded. He almost feels like crying again but this time restricts the inner piping from which his tears flow. How immature he must seem and how dull and boring the conversation must be when she is always the one giving and he does nothing but receive. He stiffly straightens his posture again as if resetting himself and the sullen attitude he just previously exhibited seems to lighten up a little. 

&quot;Comfortable questions . . . &quot; He feigns contemplation and taps his knee with his index finger, resting atop his legs. &quot;Questions that you are comfortable answering yourself are questions that are relatively safe to ask another, isn&#39;t that right?&quot; Though, he&#39;s not exactly sure the capacity of how comfortable Morgana can get is. His eyes brighten and he leans back in the chair, a bit more relaxed than before. &quot;I think that arrangement makes more sense. How about it?&quot;

He wills himself to smile though there&#39;s a sense of dread.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=sirplez><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=sirplez src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1202486314872864828.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

“Do not lie to yourself.” She stated bluntly, though her smile aimed to soften the impact of her own words.

“The first step with socializing is learning your own boundaries. Once you learn those, settings like these—“ She’d gesture towards the bustling crowd. “— and settings like this—“ Her hand would shift to point between just the two of them.  “— it will become easier to handle. Trust me, <em>I have had much practice in this arena</em>.” A hushed chuckle would soften her expression before she sat upright once more. Hands moving to smooth out her gown.

“Now then-“ She’d continue on, clapping her hands together to steer the conversation forward. “Onto the questions segment of our discussion. Let’s see….” Morgana’s gaze would draw closed for a moment as she contemplated <em>entertaining</em> questions to purpose. The desired medium being ones that weren’t too imposing, but also ones that the golem couldn’t escape with a simple yes or no answer. 

<em>decisions decisions</em>

“Hmmm, alright, I do believe I have my selection prepared.” With a clearing of her throat, Morgana’s frostbitten gaze would flicker open once more. Four fingers raised simultaneously.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1217666393995083909 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1217666393995083909><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 13, 2024 8:51 PM">8:51 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>•
“Four simple questions to start, and remember, you are free to answer which ever you are comfortable with. Wether it be none, one, or multiple, that is entirely up to you.” Her smile would remain ever present as she began to list off the options.

“<strong>Question 1</strong>. What do you do when your bored?” A broad enough question she thought. Hopefully broad enough to prevent avoidance.

“<strong>Question 2</strong>. If you were granted three wishes, what would you wish for? And no, you cannot wish for more wishes.” This one was a daring one but, it would be fun to know what the golem would answer with. 

“<strong>Question 3</strong>. When you first meet someone, what’s the first thing you notice about them?” This one she wished to hear of  the most.

“And lastly, but certainly not least, <strong>Question 4</strong>.—“ For this question, Morgana’s hand would gesture towards the crowd of people once again. “—If you could dance with another here, who would it be?” This question was mostly for her own entertainment. <img

He&#39;s already done a poor job of expressing itself and no was not any different and he hopes that Morgana can see that he will not take her words with a grain of salt. She has offered many valuable opinions and guidance for him and he knows that once he leaves the ballroom, he will have much to mull over. 

<em>Boundaries</em>. He&#39;s not even sure what she really means by the word. Sure he understands the concept of boundaries when applied to others and to respect their space and privacy. The concept itself applied to <em>him</em>? Unheard of. He&#39;d obviously put up a wall and shied away when Morgana had brought up things that made him uncomfortable or upset but to Whipstitch, he sees that more at the fault of his person and not the lack of boundaries he has set. He would think that he had <em>no</em> boundaries, in fact. Very rarely did he do things reluctantly and he saw no problems doing what was being asked of him. But his understanding of such boundaries (or lack thereof) may be the very proof of what Morgana advises him. He had no boundaries and so he struggled to find comfort in social events such as these. He&#39;d need to think long and hard of what these were and maybe then he will succeed in talking naturally with <em>normal</em> people.

Lost in thought, Whipstitch finds his mind floating away until it&#39;s grounded back to the shining ballroom floor. The opulent lights of the hall now feel hot and suffocating, like a spotlight shone directly upon him. He&#39;s decided he does not like to be the center of attention, even if that was the center of attention between two people. Was that a boundary he could set? It sounded unreasonable.

He listens to her questions carefully, as if every single word was just as important as the last regardless of their purpose in the question. They were harmless questions and even comfortably basic. Common questions to know someone yet enough to determine their valu</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1218272981508296886 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1218272981508296886><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 15, 2024 1:01 PM">1:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>es, their morals, their character. Morgana was as intelligent as she had put herself up to be. But the question now was which questions to answer. 

It&#39;s a given that the fourth question was one he could not answer and in fact had no answer to. He had no desire to dance with anyone else even out of sheer curiosity. His dance with Morgana was more than enough and while he is thankful for the gracious opportunity, he had done it out of obligation and not out of interest as her question suggests. There was someone with whom he&#39;d love to dance with but they were not present at the ball and likely would never be.  

Now it was a matter of what he&#39;d like to hear most from Morgana had she answered these questions. He considers it and decides to throw out the third question; Whipstitch had a pretty good idea of what Morgana <em>might</em> say solely from their own interaction and his answer isn&#39;t all that much more interesting. If he&#39;d answer her, he&#39;d say their <em>power</em>. He found himself fascinated by the way people carried themselves and what that meant for them. How would they use their personal power towards others? And how can that strength be mimicked, how can it be adapted? But expressing such things would make him seem calculated as if he had something to hide. He simply wanted to be the best version of himself he could possibly be. There was also the possibility that Morgana&#39;s first impression of others would be physical. Appearance. He already knew he was some sort of freak of nature and he&#39;d find it more settling to not know if someone noticed that first about him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1218273021329150094 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1218273021329150094><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 15, 2024 1:02 PM">1:02 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Whipstitch&#39;s posture continues to be artificially relaxed and his hand moves from his knees to point at to tap against his chin pensively, his other crossed at the elbows. If Morgana looked carefully and hadn&#39;t felt it when they danced, she&#39;d be able to see under the thin, flowing fabric of his sleeve that golden wiring protruded from where skin should be--bone twisted, metallic resting below an expanse of white. 

&quot;When I am bored...I like to develop skills like handicrafts. I particularly like sewing,&quot; Even the thought of needle and thread makes him feel more at ease and he smiles more naturally now from the thought. &quot;But as of recently,&quot; his eyes shift back and forth, as if he&#39;s wary of his next words. He leans forward and cups his hand close to his face, his voice just above a whisper. &quot;I think that eating is fun. Is that strange? I&#39;m not binge eater but I think that the idea of eating and enjoying a meal is fun.&quot;

He returns to his previous posture and laughs silently, a breathy chuckle that was more a display of laughter than actual laughing. The poor guy could not taste food and sure as hell could not digest it. But he was enamored by the idea of food. If he hadn&#39;t been stopped by Morgana, he&#39;d have been eating. It&#39;s for the best interest of everyone that he had not made it to the food yet. But the question had done it&#39;s purpose and he has softened up again. She had gotten over wave and it was calm waters. <em>For now</em>.

The second question made him more apprehensive. He could easily answer anything here but there were some things that he&#39;d wish for and actively strived to achieve so there was no reason to lie for comfort. This is where he <em>should</em> set a boundary. Alas. Plus, he wanted to know the deep desires and whims that would sway Morgana&#39;s fortress. What wishes were so important to someone who was so well grounded and seemed to hold the world in her hands?

His hands copy her&#39;s as he holds up three fingers; a gesture he will now copy in future conversatio</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1218273022562144376 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1218273022562144376><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 15, 2024 1:02 PM">1:02 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>ns. 

&quot;My first wish, dear genie,&quot; Whipstitch is pretty satisfied with his humor here, very cool and funny of him, &quot;is that I would like to be a better person. Rather than better, I&#39;d like to be <em>normal</em> enough to be considered a person. I appreciate the kind words and your concern for me and I think that such things will be useful.&quot; Again, there is the referral of himself as object rather than individual. He truly wants to say that he wants to be <em>human</em>. The concept of normality ties closely to what Whipstitch deems as humanity. He leaves this bit out since it&#39;s a little embarrassing.

One finger down. &quot;Second, I&#39;d like to be able to taste food,&quot; he laughs again, this time throwing his head back slightly, feather light. &quot;I want to know why people like the flavors that they do and I want to be able to taste even the most intense of things. I want to experience it all.&quot; 

Another finger down.

&quot;And lastly,&quot; His smile drops as if he&#39;s had an epiphany and his gaze returns back to the woman sitting in front of him. Blank and lifeless, he stares at her with a hollow smile still plastered on his face, &quot;I&#39;d like to die.&quot; He drops his hand and holds it neatly over his lap.

&quot;Your turn, Miss Morgana. Would you tell me your wishes?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Beneath the layers of pristine white, a glint of gold pulled her crystalline gaze. Sending a shiver down her spine in turn. The mere sight Electrifying her senses. It was like a predator sensing a trace of prey in the vastness of the ocean, her hand twitching involuntarily, tempted to call forth the metallic features that glimmered before her.

<em>Could she dare?</em> She pondered.

However, she’d quickly quelled the urge, disguising those fleeting twitches with a feigned <em>sneeze</em>. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she added, shielding her curiosity behind a veil of etiquette. Though as the other began to reveal his answers. Her urges would become easier to subdue with such a distraction.

The world would draw quiet for a moment as she processed the golems answer. Then, in harmony with the orchestras tune, a gleeful chuckle would sound from her lips. “Oh sweetie, that isn’t strange in the slightest!” Her hand would lift to stifle anymore giggles from bubbling out.

When the golem raised three fingers, Morgana would maintain a composed silence. Only her shoulders to shift with suppressed laughter from Whipstitch’s <em>genie</em> comment.  From there, she would listen with open ears. Those glaring eyes beneath her veil not pulling for a moment as he lists his answers one by one.

‘<em>To be Normal</em>’ She could empathize with the sentiment. Understanding the longing to blend in, the <em>want</em> to avoid undue attention solely based on one’s appearance. However, her own desires diverged, as she relished in the spotlight she was born in. Nevertheless, this was not her question to answer.

The next answer would elicit a warm smile to spread across her lips. The theme of food becoming rather prevalent with this one. Though, she could perhaps imagine how left out he must feel. To see others time and time again indulging in such treats and yet, you could not understand the reasoning. The <em>yearning</em> to understand.

And finally, with the last answer, Morgana’s smile would drop ever so slightly. Though it wasn’t from a place of concern. But rather, from <em>amusement</em>. For with yet another answer she finds herself standing on the opposite side of this invisible veil. To an immortal, death is peace. But to a mortal, death is inescapable.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1218406072872861768 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1218406072872861768><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 15, 2024 9:50 PM">9:50 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>•

“Ah but your genie has yet to grant you your wishes!” She’d interjected cheerfully.

“Now surprisingly-“ she’d lean in as if to whisper a secret, much like the other had done moments before. “<em>I was not born a genie</em>.” The jest would elicit another chuckle.  “However, with preparation, I do believe your first two wishes may be attainable, albeit for a limited time.” She’d offer a light smile before straightening her posture once more. Eyes scanning for the nearest refreshments table as she would quite like to partake in a cup of tea if they had it.

“Ah but such discussions can await for another evening~ For it is my turn, no?.” With her search proving to be fruitless, Morgana would return her attention to the question at hand. A question, she would be able to answer with ease.

“For my first wish, it would be simple, and a life long goal I’ve held since a child. To earn <em>Respect</em>, respect that I believe I have rightfully gained over the years and yet, it fails to be acknowledged.” She would not elaborate much further than that.

“Secondly, why…the power to summon a cup of tea at the snap of my fingers would be quite delightful! Though, I think I shall settle with, altering my body, so it may handle my magics full potential.” Her gaze would lower towards her hands for a moment. Fingers flexing as crystals began to glimmer at her fingertips. Glimpses of failed experiments flashing within her mind.

But this wasn’t the time to recollect.

“And for my last.” She’d clear her throat as her smile grew in size. “Why, I wish to challenge death itself.” Her expression would remain unchanging as such words slipped her lips. “For unlike you my dear, my life has already begun to set.” A fact she very much did not like admitting aloud, but it was the truth non the less.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1218406099057774733 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1218406099057774733><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 15, 2024 9:50 PM">9:50 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“And with that, my three wishes are concluded.

He&#39;d never been allowed to eat things to freely because...well obviously food waste would tarnish his insides and get stuck in his gears. But now that he was on his own...he&#39;d find himself drawn to shoving things in his mouth. An experimental chew, a mimicry of a reaction. He understood why people loved to eat. To think that other beings needed to eat to live...why life sounded like such a treat for them. (He ignores the nuances of what it means to require sustenance to survive.)

Morgana always seemed to be laughing in some way and it was hard not to catch the contagious energy. The thought never crossed his mind that Morgana could be ridiculing him and thankfully she was more so just amused in general than intending anything malicious. 

&quot;<em>Authenticity</em>...&quot; He repeats the new word a couple of times in a hushed whisper, repetition forcing it into his mental dictionary. &quot;Miss Morgana, what does &#39;<em>Authenticity</em>&#39; mean...?&quot; Surely it has to be something good if she pairs it with <em>endearing</em>. If it&#39;s a good word or a word of praise, he&#39;d surely love to learn it. Such words were useful and his mind was often clouded with sorrowful words. He&#39;d like to change that. Even the sound of it was intelligent. 

Now would have been a good time to ask Morgana: what she often liked to eat, what were her favourite foods, did she know how to cook? But the flow of the conversation moved much too quickly and Whipstitch loses his chance. Yet another topic of conversation to his mental list he had yet to use any of it. In fact, the flow of their conversation seemed to have an air of confrontation from the start. Or was <em>interrogation</em> a better word? Thinking back to his first meeting with Ayame, Asher, and Cendrillion, that conversation, too, was full of questioning. Is this how everyone conversed in these parts? But if he really thinks, even his topic-list was filled with questions. Was it only a matter of what was</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1218422784531632169 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1218422784531632169><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 15, 2024 10:57 PM">10:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>the <em>right *questions? There was much to think about.

He finds himself leaning forward once more, a pattern of the two mirroring each other&#39;s actions. With a craned neck and open ears, he awaits her answer. Her little joke gives him a feeling of warmth and he throws himself back with a satisfied chuckle as well. A joke shared between them felt like they were friends for this short moment. 

&quot;I think it is good to desire things that are within your reach,&quot; he says with eyes lowered as he rearranges the ruffling of his sleeve. He lets the topic rest, though. There was definitely more to his statement yet a comment of discussion continuing another time--that signified to him that there *would</em> be another time they would converse just like this. They were both inhabiting Raehn now, so it wasn&#39;t unrealistic to think they would run into each other in a different setting but Whipstitch was used to his interactions with strangers to be brief, fleeting. This felt nice. Acquiring an acqaintence...why, wouldn&#39;t that evolve into friendship? Although their start was a bit rocky and has hit a few speed bumps in between, Whipstitch thinks highly of Morgana. She is definitely someone he could learn many things from. Plus, he wanted to hear more about her culture...

He shakes his head eagerly as confirmation. Wait, would asking Morgana for her wishes count as a wish? Though she didn&#39;t say anything or make a joke on how he&#39;d given four...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1218422807449440339 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1218422807449440339><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 15, 2024 10:57 PM">10:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Her first wish was respectable in of itself. To earn respect? Hasn&#39;t she already? He finds it hard to believe that there are not others who admire her, respect her, even aspire to be her. It&#39;s almost ridiculous to think that she has not received the respect that she so highly deserves. Strange.

The second wish delights him only to make him grimace slightly. To alter your body to harness more power, energy, potential. It is not a foreign concept to him. He looks her over again now with slightly fresher eyes and wonders what she could mean by that. Did Morgana understand the implications of altering and modifying your body? To lose the autonomy of your organic nature? The consequences that come with such change were often more pain than they were worth both physically and emotionally. He knew too well the feeling of losing yourself to artificial gain. 

The last answer is something he expected. Even he had an hourglass that lost a tiny grain of sand every day yet it could not fall any slower for him. He&#39;s sure for Morgana, it must be falling at a much faster pace, time being clear as her body deteriorated with age. He felt jealous of her and he had felt envious in the past. Where his skin would remain cold and stiff from the beginning, his unfaltering youth was something that caused him great turmoil and pain. The thought of Morgana&#39;s touch, firm, pulsating, and fiery hot, turning cold like his made him unbearably sad. Even in their last moments, those with small life spans begged to hold onto their lives. 

Whipstitch felt ashamed for his own answer of desiring death. But the lives he and Morgana lived differed greatly. She wouldn&#39;t have known why he&#39;d want to return to the sea and become nothing. She couldn&#39;t. But he feels that he can understand why she&#39;d fight for her life.

As Morgana finishes divulging her life&#39;s ~deepest desires~, he finds himself more perplexed than ever in this conversation. How could they be so similar yet so different? Life was truly fasci</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1218422808887955466 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1218422808887955466><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 15, 2024 10:57 PM">10:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>nating. To think if he had cultivated his own life and was created by the hands of another, how different would he have been? He shakes away the useless thought. Shameful. Ungrateful.

&quot;Thank you for answering,&quot; He makes sure that she knows that her presence is a gift. &quot;If it makes you feel any better, Miss Morgana, I do hope that others will respect you as you wish to be respected. I can say for myself that even in our short time knowing one another, I hold you in high regard and I believe that others do too with the way that you carry yourself,&quot; Whipstitch hopes that his words provide at least a little comfort as her encouragement has for him.

His hands clasp together in excitement when she mentions refreshments. Their conversation, while engaging, was starting to teeter into heavy territory (it had already been there for quite some time now). He took after her own decisions and did not press further of her other wishes. As she said, those were things to be discussed another time. He finds the corners of his lips upturned at the thought. Slow to rise, he sighs a loud, drawn out sigh. Dramatic and overexaggerated, he wills himself back to his feet. 

&quot;I suppose I can,&quot; As opposed to his actions, his tone is lighthearted. He steps aside for Morgana to lead the way, hoping that she didn&#39;t mean the invitation as a cue for him to leave..!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not minding in the slightest as she let herself relish in <s>ego boosting</s> mood lifting words.

Oh but how that little hand clap was the most darling way to end this portion of their conversation. Despite the mans appearance, she couldn&#39;t help but envision him as almost child-like, with his reactions and curious demeanor. She recalled him stating during this meeting of their’s how he had not been ‘out for long.’ a detail she was intrigued to explore one day in the future.

But for now, Refreshments~

As the pair rose, Morgana would sweep her hand to return the chairs from whence they came. Surely no one minded that she borrowed them for but a few moments~

“Now, what was it you asked…ah yes, Authenticity.” She’d lull her words before taking the much needed lead towards the refreshments. Now that she stood at her full height, she could spy it’s location with ease.

“By definition it means, true to one’s person. So when I used it, I meant that you do not hide behind a mask. But rather, that you speak from your heart.” Her hand would tap at the center of her own chest. Burying the intrusive thought that crossed  her mind that perhaps <em>’core’</em> would have been a far more accurate answer. But, the fellow was dealing with enough golem identity issues as is. Wouldn’t hurt to sprinkle in a bit of humanizing terms~

“Not many possess such a trait nowadays. So to see it first hand why, what a <em>refreshing</em> meet this has been. And that is before we have even reached the refreshments table~” A small chuckle would curl her lips.

“Though, since we are on our way to partake in <em>one</em> of your favorite pass times, might I bother you to tell me more of your first favored hobby? Sewing, correct? Perhaps one day we can sit down and sew together. Though, I do hope you do not mind taking on the mentoring role.

It was not something to be used to, especially when it was his first time seeing such a thing. But he supposes that he has his own strange abilities and he&#39;d witnessed Ayame and Cendrillion perform strange things as well. A puzzle for yet to be solved but he&#39;s not sure if it&#39;s one that he can.

His steps are small and cautious and he keeps himself behind Morgana rather than beside her, trailing after her like a baby duck follows its mother. A comfortable distance but not far away enough to be considered rude or to have him constantly trying to keep pace with her. The sound of their heels clicking amongst the ambience of the dance.

Whipstitch mulls over the description that Morgana gives him, wonders if he truly is <em>authentic</em>. He knows that she means he does not &quot;hide behind a mask&quot; figuratively, but he can&#39;t help thinking that that wasn&#39;t true. His face <em>was</em> a mask but he would be lying if he didn&#39;t say he&#39;d been even a little deceptive of his person. Though, Whipstitch always did carry himself with his heart on his sleeve as much as he thinks not. His hands finds itself to his own chest but all he feels is the ticking of machinery, like a heartbeat steady and resonant but otherwise empty. 

The brooding ceases and his face brightens. &quot;I&#39;m glad you seem to think so, Miss Morgana,&quot; His body instinctively bows a little, &quot;Would you consider yourself to have &#39;<em>Authenticity</em>&#39;?&quot; It was a loaded question for someone like Morgana but Whipstitch couldn&#39;t know that. If anyone asked him, he&#39;d say that she did.

The mention of sewing makes him catch up pace with her, his steps hurrying to be beside her rather than behind in his excitement. &quot;Could we really do that?&quot; again, the words come out almost out of breath. He was ecstatic.

&quot;There are many things one can do with sewing. Isn&#39;t it wonderful? You</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1218681903377551441 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1218681903377551441><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, March 16, 2024 4:06 PM">4:06 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>can create many beautiful things with just a needle and a thread. Tiny objects that seem otherwise insignificant and it can become something grand.&quot; A sing-song tone takes over him and he hums, his gaze sweet as he looks into the distance dreamily. &quot;I&#39;d be more than happy to assist you, even if it has been a while, it is not hard to learn the motions once again,&quot;

Unconsciously, his hands sway from side to side, like a conductor at the foreground of an orchestra, his fingers lacing thread upon an invisible fabric. &quot;Oh, Miss Morgana, is there something you want to make? I will do my best to show you how--&quot; he was getting ahead of himself now.

He grounds himself back, his hands falling back to his sides politely before he sheepishly flourishes his sleeve in a bow. He&#39;s embarrassed to show off like this but his excitement talking over something he loved so dearly seemed to overflow. &quot;It&#39;s true that this was made by me. Do you think it suits me? Though it does not compare to the tailoring of the dress worn by you,&quot;

The garment in question was undoubtedly made by someone with years of experiencing in sewing. Even for a hobbyist, Whipstitch dedicated much of his free time to it and in turn had developed a very meticulous way of tailoring. His clothes flowed loosely and naturally and greatly contrasted the stiff body that wore it.

Hands cupped in front of her as she continued to make her way towards the refreshments table.

“I unfortunately cannot answer such a question myself.” Her smile would find it’s way towards Whipstitch’s direction. Curled lips peeking from beneath her veil.

“I would like to <em>think</em> I am authentic, yes. Everyone would love to be seen as such. However, it is up to those around me, and how I am perceived through their eyes that the true answer is found.” Of course she knows the true answer to this question but, she can’t so easily give it away now can she? Besides, now it opens up even further opportunities to meet with this <em>intriguing</em> character. “So, how about down the line of our future meetings, when you feel comfortable on that answer, <em>you</em> tell <em>me</em>, if you think I am Authentic.” Her smile would widen further before pulling her gaze away. The refreshments table was not far off now. Just a few clumps of gathered people to navigate around.

“Our future sewing meet will be an excellent step towards revealing that answer.” Seeing how once again the golem seemed to <em>beam</em> with life on the topic, she would place all her cards into this portion of the conversation for now. Her gaze flickering to catch their child-like happiness from discussing such a beloved hobby, only to retreat his excitement for a more poised demeanor. What makes him hold back she wonders? For from her perspective it is almost like he was being scolded for behaving so animatedly? Did someone <em>else</em> ingrain this behavior? Or is it something he <em>forces</em> upon himself. Something…to remind him that he was not fully human? Her mind would drift back towards their previous talking points.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1224496989224308856 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1224496989224308856><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 1, 2024 5:13 PM">5:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>•
“I certainly have projects I would <em>adore</em> to tackle in the art of sewing. Though, that topic can await for when we have needle and thread within our hands. For now…” As they reached the refreshments table, Morgana would pause to turn towards the golem. Gesturing both hands towards his entire figure as if guiding a beaming spotlight to befall him. “Let us admire this <em>marvelous</em> craftsmanship you wear tonight! Goodness my outfit is the run of the mill order where as yours-“ Her motherly smile would return. “Nothing beats an item worn by the own crafters hands.” With a careful step she would close the space between them just a bit further, only so she could accurately point out specific pieces of this outfit to admire.

“Is this a fishtail style braiding along the collar of the cloak?” She’d guide her finger to point, taking extra care not to touch the man. “Oh and the quilted patterning just aside, my…how  that takes quite a bit of talent to continue such a clean and concise patterning throughout.” Her knowledge of fashion wasn’t all that expansive though she would try to pull out certain terminology to keep the golems passionate topic flowing.

“And don’t get me started on how you managed to drape the fabric. Like magnificent rivers encompassing your body. Goodness…what a treat to know such a talented designer as yourself.” She would reach to grab a nearby plate and custard pastry before offering it towards the golem. A treat for the treat <img

Clearly, she expressed herself in such a way that it was hard not to think so, right? (He was na&#239;ve as he was dense to deception from others.) It made him curious though--what actions dictated such opinions from others because surely there had to be more to it than just following and speaking from the heart. What perception did others have of Morgana that she seems to continuously allude to? Should he be wary? No, he thinks not. She was someone misunderstood but with a strong conviction and equally as strong heart. He know women like her and he knows that they are easily misunderstood....

He wastes no time answering her suggestion, &quot;In this moment I believe that you are, Miss Morgana. You know already that I think highly of you,&quot; It was a comment that could sound snide from any other person but Whipstitch says it whole-heartedly. It would be hard for her to sway his opinion of her unless she&#39;d done something truly terrible but there was no way that she would.

Unconsciously, Whipstitch draws closer to her, eager to hear what projects she&#39;s looking to complete. He wanted to be useful and he felt a sense of comradery now that he&#39;s successfully conversed with someone this long to make a new friend. He&#39;s left slightly disappointed, though, but the repeated notion of a future meeting sometime far away, even if just courtesies and pleasantries, was enough of an affirmation to satisfy him. 

He shies away at her praise, suddenly feeling disproportionately embarrassed about his brazen display of his own craftmanship. Did he seem cocky? Too proud? He doesn&#39;t want Morgana to think that he thinks too highly of himself (much the opposite, really). &quot;That is not true, yours is much more expertly tailored...&quot; he says it with a voice so small that it seems he only mouths the words rather than vocalizes them. When she takes a step forward, he takes a half-step back again, bashful and hiding himself behind the dr</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1225123261969596582 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1225123261969596582><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 3, 2024 10:42 AM">10:42 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>apery of white that hangs off him. 

The continuous onslaught of comments is hard for Whipstitch to keep up with and he fears that if Morgana keeps looking so closely, she&#39;ll start seeing mistakes instead of things to commend. Instead, he redirects the conversation, &quot;If you enjoy my garment so much, I would be honoured to one day sew something for you to maybe wear. Or maybe not...&quot; He couldn&#39;t pressure her but he <em>was</em> more experienced crafting women&#39;s clothes than anything else.

It never occured to him that they&#39;d reach the refreshments already. He&#39;d become so absorbed in their conversation that the rest of the ball had become a blur separate from the two of them. He blinks at the plate before taking it in his hand, hesitating to just stick the little pastry in his mouth immediately. His lip quivers slightly.

&quot;Here and there and everywhere,&quot; He&#39;s laughing too but it is as short as his answer. His mind has already drifted to the sweets laid outbefore him. Decadence through and through, you could tell a lot about a host by the food they choose to serve (or so he&#39;s heard). It was amazing how everything could be eaten and he feels sorry to the chefs and patisseries who spent countless hours meticulously decorating such things only for them to be devoured. Oh how he wished he could taste them to appreciate the work to its fullest extent--</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1225123898077741118 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1225123898077741118><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 3, 2024 10:44 AM">10:44 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He clears his throat and waits for Morgana&#39;s cue. It would be rude of him to start eating without her. Holding back was the only option...He&#39;s not even sure if he can keep up a conversation at this point if he was already this distracted. &quot;Thank you very much for gracing me with your presence tonight, Miss Morgana,&quot; the plate is still firm in his hand.

&quot;I&#39;m happy to know that there are people like you in Raehn and it provides me a sense of comfort and security. If you find that you&#39;d like my company again, do not hesitate to find me and I will have a needle ready for the two of us. Or well...one for each..&quot; He&#39;d fumbled so quickly...

Whipstitch gives a small bow with plate still held in a deathgrip between his fingers and the pastry slides a little, nearly falling off. With a struggle, he manages to prevent it from getting on the floor while he hastily sets it back in place, the custard staining the fabric of his sleeve. &quot;This is where I&#39;ll let you enjoy the rest of your night,&quot; a nod of his head and he&#39;s off...to the other side of the table still in Morgana&#39;s view but slightly...away from her. 

He feels bad for cutting their conversation short but it felt an appropriate time to allow the woman her own space after he&#39;d occupied so much of her time. Surely it was not because his thoughts were elsewhere..</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“I am sure it will not be long before I seek your company.” Her gentle smile would remain ever present, even as she notices a bit of custard now staining the mans garments. Though she wouldn’t announce it to the world. Instead, she would grab the same pastry from the table. Placing it delicately on a plate of her own.

“May you enjoy the rest of your evening, Sir Whipstitch~” Her gaze would pull away from the golem now. Returning the mans space to him for good on this night. 

“It has been a pleasure to meet such a fascinating new soul.” With her plate in hand, she would make her way past the golem. Her gaze focused upon the crowd as she searched for one face in particular. But as she passed, she would sneak on final comment to the man before departing fully.

“And, as a parting word- It would be a dream to wear one of your creations~” Her gaze would finally locate the  face she’d been searching for. Their tiny yellow dress like a shooting star as she scampered through the crowded.

“Until next time~” And with that, Morgana would be off to hunt down her daughter.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
