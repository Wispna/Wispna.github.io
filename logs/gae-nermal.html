Another melody tickles Gaes mind. <em>&quot;I bring gifts to her majesty.&quot;</em> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nibsscribs">@10 hrs of chimp noises</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not in herself, no, she could never be, but in the people of Raehn. Honestly, here she was offering them a celebration, a chance to discuss culture, history, the legacy of each of their people, and they&#39;d rather starve out of sheer pettiness. Not all of them of course. There were her acolytes, as well as Yuda and Morgana, but the majority of the citizens refused to participate. An attempt to humiliate her, most likely, or an attempt to draw out her wrath, to make her become the autocrat they all seem to think she is. The thought makes her smirk to herself. Fools. So simpleminded, they can&#39;t comprehend the true scope of her plans. But that&#39;s the thinking of a group of people who only know survival for you. Gaelynd offers them a chance to know more, to live in a way that fills the whole word, encompasses all that it means. But worms are simply worms, in the end. 

She glances up at Ziel, eyes narrowing. &quot;It&#39;s an exclusive event.&quot; She sniffs, trying not to take Ziels bait but still arguing in her own way. &quot;The uncultured and the bigoted have chosen to stay out. There were more than I thought living here in Raehn.&quot; She deadpans. 

&quot;Oh? Redeeming yourself after avoiding the festival?&quot; Of course he couldn&#39;t resist coming here. &quot;I&#39;ll indulge your request. What gifts do you bring for me. And just Lady is fine as a title. Though I can&#39;t stop you from giving me higher honors, the people of this town will take issue with your words. They reflect back on me.&quot; She narrows her eyes again. &quot;But I don&#39;t need to explain that to you.&quot;

The lil&#39; kittens hissing had been endearing enough that light steps had brought him to Gaelynds side of the table to take an even more entitled seat than hers-- right on top of the booth. A white box would then be presented to her before Ziel gestured with his lips for her to open it up. 

<em>&quot;It&#39;s my favorite dessert from back home.&quot;</em> Inside Gae will find two cups of shaved ice, each glowing in a gentle golden light that only an Ederlin berry could produce. <em>&quot;We usually make it from the first snow of the season. The fluffy texture of a snowflake cluster is like no other snow out there. It softly melts in your mouth and the flavour of the crystalized water lingers on your tongue even after the added sweetness is long gone.</em>&quot; He reminisce. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nibsscribs">@10 hrs of chimp noises</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Don&#39;t you know anything about proper hygiene when it comes to food.&quot; She rolls her eyes as he sits on the booth. &quot;Well, I&#39;d tell you to get your ass away from the pizza but-&quot; She gives him an appraising look. &quot;I&#39;ll allow it.

She takes the white box off of Ziel&#39;s hands and opens it, appraises his words. &quot;Then you come from the countryside? The snow of the city is polluted  before it even lands. But this-&quot; She sniffs the ice curiously. &quot;Mmm, a pure smell, like wind.&quot; She retrieves the two cups from inside the box. &quot;And I assume the second cup is for you? Hm, and here I was doubting that you understood the reason behind the festival. It&#39;s not just giving food, it&#39;s sharing it. A meal tastes better with another person you know.&quot; She takes a scoop of the treat, then lets it melt on her tongue. &quot;Light. Like a virgin&#39;s kiss. And very refreshing.&quot; She inclines her head to Ziel. &quot;And you? What does this treat mean to you. Perhaps making it with family? Making your own attempt as a child? Some light and glowing love you shared with another?&quot;

Ziel relaxes into her touch, holding his own hands up in the air as if to declare defeat. 

&quot;<em>Ah, you caught me in the act, my Queen. I am indeed here for my own, personal fun. Only you have shown your hands and I&#39;m eager- No, I&#39;m /yearning/ for the entertainment your brilliance can provide.</em>&quot;

When Ziel moves, the world quiets down. Not even the wind dares to put any resistance to his arms that swung gracefully around Gaelynds neck, locking her in his embrace. &quot;<em>And since you figured me out so effortlessly, well, then I see no point in holding my mind.</em>&quot; 

&quot;<em>I think you feel like you&#39;ve been wronged. Like someone is walking all over you, and perhaps this small town too, and you had to take a stance.

This needling thought in the back of her mind itches at her psyche. She grips Ziel&#39;s cheek firmer, more possessively. 

&quot;I appreciate your honesty. I also appreciate deception. It&#39;s a skill to know the occasion for both.&quot; She states blithely. She lets his arms fall around her neck with a smirk, tilting her head up to get a better look at him. They&#39;re both so vulnerable to the other right now... <img

The silence that surrounds them makes her skin prickle with goosebumps. What power does Ziel possess? She doesn&#39;t doubt he could be a fearsome enemy, but the only threat of danger she feels is getting her excited. &quot;I&#39;ve been wronged.&quot; She tilts her head back and forth ruminating on it. &quot;It&#39;s certainly a plausible theory, with evidence to back it up.. And I must say I&#39;m glad you haven&#39;t gone with that trite theory that I&#39;m attempting to take over the town to rule over it as a queen. Perish the thought! It&#39;s not my style.&quot; She sighs. 

&quot;A trap! Well, I think some of the smarter townsfolk have figured at least that much out, though that&#39;s not the full scope.&quot; She reveals. &quot;But I&#39;m not worried about the status quo. Don&#39;t you find the status quo to be so terribly boring? The people of Raehn are a complacent bunch. It&#39;s why they find themselves so entranced by me, unbound by the chains of contentment or normalcy. Tell me Ziel, you&#39;re new to this town as well. What do you know about it. What have &quot;they&quot; told you of it? Do you think it could be more than it is right now.&quot;

She rubs his chin soothingly with her thumb, eyes intense. &quot;You carry yourself like a noble - a born noble, I should say. But you have a curious mind, and that means more to me than any title... perhaps I could tell you more.&quot; 

She sighs. &quot;Ugh, perhaps you people want me to rule, considering how focused you all are on it, inviting me over and over to consider the prospect. But you are right, it is contradicting.

Almost more than the information that she was willing to spill for free. It was intriguing. Even her slight, but rough handling told a tale he wanted to listen to. 

Ziels now tilted head would offer her a coy smile. It was his turn to monologue.

<em>&quot;Myes... Opposite that compliments each other do indeed go hand in hand. But you my dear are nothing but a walking contradiction that&#39;s starting to sound like a broken record.

Taste was a forgotten but vital sense to determining something&#39;s nature. Akiu was earthy, lightly spiced from slaving over his kitchen. Sigmund, she imagined, tasted syrupy, artificial but rich. Most expensive meals were. Ziel tasted much like the dessert he had given her; light and cool but where the treat was sweet like young love, Ziel was bitter. &quot;Like poison.&quot; She murmurs, amused. 

Gaelynd pinches her brow at Ziel&#39;s condescension. &quot;My darling, has anyone ever told you that sonorous voice of yours is enough to give someone tinnitus? It&#39;s like an opera where the castrato only knows one pitch. Levels, dear, levels. Surely you can modulate that thing somewhat?&quot; She lets his head go, instead running the hand down his arm. &quot;You may have your thoughts on what I&#39;m trying to accomplish. I simply believe in striving for improvement, plain and simple. You&#39;re mute, correct? Not blind as well? Then you should see that this town&#39;s armor has thousands of chinks. Exploitable, especially with the townsfolk the way they are. Why shouldn&#39;t someone give them a wake up call? And have a little bit of fun at the same time.&quot; 

Gaelynd gives him a pitying look. &quot;I fear you won&#39;t enjoy the festival very much at all, not if you enjoy the taste of boot that much.&quot; She barely gets through the sentence without cackling. &quot;I happen to reserve my jealousy for very esteemed individuals. But enough about me. You talk to me of satisfaction and the ills of rejecting complacency, but let me tell you this.&quot; She leans forward. &quot;I can recognize insatiability.&quot;

I may ask for something in return though. Something of equal value- or should I say equal effort. Any part of me is worth it&#39;s weight in gold.&quot; She laughs. Maybe Ziel would make a doll out of it. He could be a doll guy. 

Gaelynd pouts. &quot;Oh? You&#39;d like for me to react to you as if you were a vicious mob? Shall I bend you over this table and tie you up? Perhaps you think corporeal punishment is a proper response? I&#39;m sure then I could get your voice to do something new.&quot; Her tongue darts out once again to wet her lips, her eyes wide with new hunger. Of course, Gaelynd was non violent, but... &quot;I have a pair of boots back at the tavern.&quot; She can&#39;t help but let out a rough laugh, voice lowering. 

She smirks back at him. &quot;Clearly subtlty is neither of our strong suits. See, this is why I could never be the leader of Raehn. Far too much hinting and gesturing and not enough getting to the point.&quot; She places a hand on his thigh. &quot;People so hate to be controlled by desire, but it&#39;s a current. You can use it, work with it.&quot; She pats his leg. &quot;This dessert. A selfish desire, no? Binding yourself to another. And you only told me of it&#39;s purpose after I partook, sly boy. <em>Bring the snow to the person you desire</em> I believe you said? I bring everything I am to what I desire.&quot; She pauses and scratches lightly with her fingernails, considering. &quot;I&#39;m no miracle, not the one you&#39;re looking for at least, but I can bring satisfaction. Though, if you mean you can barely feel a tingle I can happily join you in visiting Sigmund. Certainly he has potions for that problem.&quot; She giggles.

And Ziel was ready to give it all when one, single name shattered the dream and Ziel had to fight not to gag right there and then. To Gaelynd, the trembling that followed hearing Sigmunds name could all but be an adrenaline rush of excitement coursing through his veins, instead of disdain that that mans name had to be involved in his affairs.

<em>&quot;I must disappoint you again my Queen, for I kept this dessert incomplete. I had to see first for myself if you were worthy of such a... Commitment.&quot;</em> Without addressing any of her wild suggestions, Ziel finally set Gaelynd&#39;s hair free of his grip to procure a heart shaped bottle from a flash of light. The pink liquid inside sloshed against the glass as it fell gently into Ziels now free hand. <em>&quot;Your miracle. Better known as Adoras bathwater.

Though she did seem close to the mark. &quot;You know, I did so enjoy investigating with you in Myrren. We could... <em>uncover</em> so much more together.&quot; And she still has that Adora Passiflora. Ah choices choices. 

She watches with hungry eyes as he pulls out the potion. &quot;Selfish desire indeed!&quot; She seems more excited than bothered, though it&#39;s quite rude to even question her worthiness. &quot;But a miracle, no. Miracles are not something you can grab in a pinch, bought and sold. They are earned. Bestowed.&quot; Granted she had just suggested they go to Sigmund to fix Ziel&#39;s dick, but she was taking it more seriously now. In some way she missed the pull on her scalp, and couldn&#39;t help but feel scornful at the bottle that had taken that hand away. &quot;A potion that takes away autonomy, setting everything on Adora&#39;s little set script, if it even is hers.&quot; She has her suspicions. &quot;You give straightforward answers, I just need to know where to look.&quot; Ziel&#39;s desire. She can feel the shape of it now, like a depression in metal. Cold. Empty. Incomplete. She&#39;d could fill it, pour herself into it. What a risk. Yet she yearns. 

&quot;I have no taste for your so-called peace. I doubt such a thing as true peace exists in this world, but this is no piece, this fragile, insecure thing. Is it such a sin, to have a curiosity?&quot;

&quot;The dish was not incomplete. Adora&#39;s bathwater is far too cloying a flavor, it would flatten out everything else. We&#39;ll see the snow together, soon. I have no need for such deceptions- you will be worthy of my commitment.&quot; Soon.

You certainly have a way with words-- For the untrained ear they may very well be nonsensical, but to me, they are clear as first snow. Crystal clear. Well... Almost.”</em> Ziel lets a small smile slide before looking down at the liquid.&#160;

<em>“Then how about this: This bathwater was bestowed onto us by the Goddess herself- A miracle. Then we have you coming forth, like a beacon of light, to illuminate the correct path for Raehn to take. An extraordinary event that, as of now at least, can not be explained by logic.

The bottle in Ziel&#39;s hand began to fog lightly at his fingertips, almost as if the love potion was burning hot from the inside, yearning to spread its unconditional love between the two. It pulsated in his hand, demanding to be let out. But Ziel did not listen to its non-existent pleas and instead pressed the glass against Gaelynds chest, right where her heart was beating.&#160;

And then he did something quite unusual; he parted his lips for the first time as if to speak the words that were now simultaneously flowing into the feroxis mind. <em>“...A <strong>festival</strong> that takes away autonomy, setting everything to <strong>Gaelynds’</strong> little set script, if it even is hers.”</em>

For just a split second though it would seem as if his words began to overlap each other, almost as if Ziels own cascading thoughts <em>“̴-̶-̶Y̸o̵u̴-̶-̷-̸-̶H̵o̴w̷ ̸s̵w̷e̷e̸t̷-̵---”̶ &#160;_had entered her mind, drowning out anything he was currently saying to her.

&quot;Bold of you to assume I have a script. Nothing compares to the raw drama of reality.&quot; Her tone is still proud, even if she feels put on her back foot. &quot;I simply set the scene.

Really, let me know, I&#39;d be happy to take you on as a man servant.&quot; The distance in her words feels right, feels more comfortable. 

She frowns at his garbled words. Is this prion disease again? &quot;I enjoyed your dessert, Ziel. It is a shame you never partook yourself. We shall talk again. If nothing else I can teach you to speak- er, project your voice more clearly.&quot; Her hand smooths her skirt, furrowed brow betraying her calm words. She reaches for one of her peach wines.
