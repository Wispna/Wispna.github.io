Thus, it stands to reason that where one goes ahead, one follows behind dutifully as his careful assistant.

&quot;Enoch!&quot; comes a tender voice bathed in equal parts indignant, and yet, borders on something concerned all at once. &quot;Where did you go?&quot; Clad in an outfit picked out by the other, she lightly finds that her boots catch upon an invisible surface. She stumbles over the accumulating snow that is not visible to her eyes and bristles with embarrassment as she rights herself. The weather was not ideal for her, and static crackles around her in a sense of unease as she tries to find her bearings. 

It is not one of her first snowfalls since meeting Enoch, but the sensation of delicate frozen snowflakes lightly kissing her skin remains a wonder to her each time. In Dreto, snow was viewed behind a window that she had no privilege to. But winter days were always filled with the warmth of a crackling fire in the workshop which the two of them shared even when the shop was empty. Silence in their company, but loud where songs of ringing bells filled the outside streets. Winter makes her recall one of her favorite stories, of a girl wielding a single matchstick.

Wisps of what must be a warm breath crystallized into the air follows her every exhale. Though she cannot see it, she relishes in remembering what she had been told. Marble colored eyes blink where she feels the sensation of something frozen touch the tip of her nose like a fleeting butterfly. Though it&#39;s startling, and disturbs her senses, she seems to smile in the snowfield. Ebony doll-like legs follow her clumsy movements, and she tucks frost bitten limbs under long sleeves made to her taste. It&#39;s very very blurry, and even worse where there is hardly light she can detect, but she manages to saunter to his position. Cendri cups her face, almost as though she were acting cute, yet the very coy smile she wears says anything but. &quot;What were you doing?&quot;</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=bigcrai><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=bigcrai src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1079947582157111306.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=SCRE><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=SCRE src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1085219216858300416.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=cryshake><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=cryshake src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1102330862332280934.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=BUTWHY><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=BUTWHY src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1102333148269924442.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=sockcherish><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=sockcherish src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1170701440583483513.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

 “I—“ His voice would crack but a small clearing of his throat would right it. Swallowing back the guilt that dared to make itself known. “I apologize.”

A hand would out stretch, reaching only until he felt the pricks of static brush against his fingertips. Then, he would freeze. Knowing good and well she knew where he was at this very moment. As well as the guiding hand that reached out for her.

<em>Should</em> she wish to take it of course. It was merely there at her own convenience. 

“I was testing the snowfall.” His foot would tap against the snow riddled ground. Showing the woman through <em>sound</em>, just how much currently coated the ground.

“The results were not pristine but…there seems to be just enough snow here, to build a small statured snowman…should one wish.” His words would pause for a moment. Gaze befalling Cendri as he tried to read her expression.

“Might that…be something you wish to do?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was like being unceremoniously dumped into the deeper parts of the abyss, in the marine trenches where she could only rely on the currents, and the antennae upon her head. Still, she acts as though nothing was wrong, a mask to deceive the recipient of her feelings of discomfort. 
She drops the act momentarily, but she&#39;s quick enough not to let Enoch catch on.

&quot;Apologize for what?&quot; She bows her head, letting the longer parts of her contrasting hair to cascade down that hides her expression away. She bends to pick up a clump of that very offending object that had tripped her. It&#39;s cold to the touch even through her gloves, and she drops it after testing out the feeling of it sitting on her palms. &quot;It&#39;s cold!&quot; She remarks almost childishly. Her cheeks are marred with a deep dust of red, including the tip of her nose as though she were struggling to keep warm. Enoch&#39;s attire for her is adorned in fur ends, with consideration to the aesthetics of it all. She had once lived in the ocean where the water could reach frigid temperatures, yet, she can&#39;t get used to how the seasons change upon land almost on a whim.

The merfolk&#39;s hand extends gingerly, hovering about in the air as though she were searching for something on a shelf before finding purchase on gloved fingertips. She gently grips them before flexing and relaxing her hand to use him as a guiding crutch. It&#39;s faint, almost like she could be blown away like the leaves preparing for winter. Cendri treats him like a beloved escort who would take her by the hand from her carriage and bring her to a dance. But she is no Cinderella despite what her name suggests. Cendri is simply the unnamed character who stands to the side with their silhouette because shadows make the spotlight that much brighter.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1186187892750561292 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1186187892750561292><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, December 17, 2023 11:07 PM">11:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She grows silent as she listens to the way his feet tap mutedly upon the ground, muffled by the snow, yet loud enough for her to determine how heavy it must be. It&#39;s a habit Enoch takes on whenever she&#39;s around, though she has assured him she did not need to be burdened by extra effort.
There&#39;s a wry smile on her face, but the lacking light of her eyes makes it unreadable to understand what that meant. &quot;Not everything can go correctly the first time. Even prodigies don&#39;t compose pieces up on the spot!&quot; She comments, but with more pep and enthusiasm like she wished to comfort him. 

Pivoting upon her feet like she had stopped through the mid waltz of a figure skater on a frozen lake, she turns to stare at where she assumes he is watching her. Gauging her reaction as she&#39;s learned to understand over the time they&#39;ve stayed together. &quot;Toys aren&#39;t just for children are they? I don&#39;t see why we can&#39;t have our own fun.&quot; He&#39;s taught her that enough. 

Suddenly, it was like an epiphany had put its pieces together in her mind. <em>(She is wrong.)</em>
With a very odd misunderstanding in her head, that Enoch needed an excuse so he could play and experiment on the snow without looking strange, she nods. Cendri did not mind being that excuse. &quot;Of course, it&#39;s not everyday I get to see a living snowman.&quot; She says, voice taking on a pleasant timbre.

“I apologize, for not informing you of my whereabouts.” His arm would lift as Cendri pirouetted on one foot. Reminiscent of a ballerinas bound by their music box. But he would not bound her. Instead, as she stood on her toes and began to pivot, he to would move his hand so her spin would be seamless. Her brightened demeanor one he dared not dampen. Even if, he was still determining how much of it was a mask.

“And I am honored to be in the presence of a prodigy.” With gentle care, Enoch would guide Cendri to kneel down in the snow. A slight shuffling of his cloak would follow as he laid it flat against the cold surface. Allowing Cendri a warm Barrier between herself and the bitter snow below.

“If anyone shall grant the snow new life. It should be you.” His umber gaze would lift to search for hers.

A storybook that she had long closed, and decided that it was over.

&quot;Did you think I&#39;ll forgive you so easily?&quot; She says, her face schooling itself into something disgruntled, outrage in her tone before it eases just as quickly. The narrowing of her eyes lifts, and she smiles. &quot;You&#39;re forgiven.&quot; She didn&#39;t want to be burdened by such an insignificant thing.
A lie she lets leaves her lips just as easily as breathing. Acting is an art of lying, and she was a convincing liar. 

The eternal backdrop of ice covered branches and blankets of snow makes it look surreal with their improvised skate session. A push and a pull of two dancing figures in the clasp of a wooden intricate box, around and around they go. 

Cendri pauses at his words, a delay in her response as though she wished to say something but deigns not to share. The shadows cast on her face are like an ominous omen where silver eyes stare off to the ground, obscuring the bite of what would be something colder.
She raises a brow questioningly, &quot;I make a few trinkets once and I&#39;ve become the prodigy?&quot; She says, though her tone edges on something light and airy. 

Almost as though the scene were visible to her, Cendri&#39;s head snaps upwards, the single branching rhinophore upon her head reacting to the sound.
She pats along the ground, finding woven material instead and inclines her head to where she thinks the visage of Enoch is looming over her. Her lip curls, lightly pulling to a thin line uncertain if it was a grimace or an amused smile. &quot;Enoch, you&#39;ll catch a cold.&quot; She says disapprovingly, even as she rests on her artificial limbs atop the makeshift blanket. She pats the space next to her, an invitation for him to join her so he did not have to be crouching in an undignified way. She has to save some of his reputation after all.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1186379186651275275 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1186379186651275275><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, December 18, 2023 11:47 AM">11:47 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Blank glass stares back, no reflection to be seen except the expanse of stars glittering in a clear sky, an aurora that decorates her glazed gaze. But it is without doubt that she is looking directly at him, deeply as though she sees what laid underneath flesh and bone. 

Life is something that is easily taken away, not so much as given. Even if something walks and talks...if it had no will, could it be considered living? She wonders on that, knowing of ghosts and phantoms that simply <em>live</em> by existing. 
It was an ironic statement to bestow upon her, knowing the responsibility that was laid on her hands that were covered in toxins more often than not. For now, what laid underneath her gloves was safe to touch, but on other days would be nothing less than agony to even brush skin against briefly. 

This was a very strange and roundabout way to say that Enoch wanted to play with snow, but Cendri did not mind. She was an extension of Enoch&#39;s thoughts, and his very limbs. A useful doll that did not hold her creator in the revered light of divinity, but who said that they needed such things?
Cendri uses a single gloved finger to trace indents along the snow as though she were sampling a specimen. Upon closer inspection, it&#39;s a poor mimicry of what Enoch had been attempting earlier, not drawn seriously. 

&quot;I promise nothing.&quot; She says brightly. &quot;It might look a little crude, but my assistant should be able to handle such things right?&quot; As if to prove a point, she rolls up a ball of white into a semi deformed circle. When she pats it, some of it falls away. She laughs, and gestures to Enoch with an open palm. &quot;Oh great assistant, please get me two leaves.&quot;

Even through the faint changes he could see it. She was always so meticulous with it, whenever she would bare her mask for the public eye. Careful to play the part she wishes for them to see. And it would seem. He was one with the public eye at this very moment. One of the many to be met with her protective mask.

He wouldn’t respond towards her spoken forgiveness. Even if there was whispers of truth within it, he himself decided he did not deserve it. He will do better. He can do better…he just…he just needs to understand how upset her to start.

“Even the greatest creators began small.” He’d mutter. A sinking feeling weighing down his shoulders as if he’d spoken another mistake. Another phrase to make her walls go up.

A childish thought would whisper in his mind if he was perhaps better not speaking at all. Maybe then, he wouldn’t become a cloud that darkens Cendri’s day. But he knows from past experience how such a reaction would be poor. And thus, he’d try to rectify his wrongs.

“You may not promise, but I-“ he’d give the hand he held a small squeeze. “I promise I can handle this task. And I <em>promise</em>, I will return.” His head would turn to try and count the paces needed to reach the leaves she required and how many would be needed to return.

“24 paces.” He’d mumble at first before turning to say it yet again with more confidence. “24 paces, and I shall join you, right back here.” He knows how deeply she holds promises. So maybe, if he can hold this one true, Cendri’s day could yet remain bright.

And with that, Enoch would slowly release Cendri’s gloved hand. Careful to signal his departure before turning to retrieve the leaves for his mission.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1186417338015297716 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1186417338015297716><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, December 18, 2023 2:18 PM">2:18 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>•
“1…2…3-“ Enoch would whisper to himself as he counted each step he took.

“11…12…13.” He grabs the two leaves he had intended before turning to walk towards Cendri once more.

“21…22…23-“ He pauses. Realizing a fatal error in his calculations as he pauses <em>two</em> steps away. 

He was one step short <img

A heavy exhale would cause a large cloud to billow in front of his face. Eyes focusing on the spot he needed to jump to. All he needed to do, was just bend his knees, and launch. That was it. He could do it….just envision….the leaping frog models from his toy shop.

Bend…and leap…bend- his knees would bend into position. And…<em>LEAP</em>!

Snow would fly as the man put all his strength behind his zero momentum leap. And it would be rocky but- he would land right next to Cendri in the end. And he would land, right on 24 paces. His arms just minorly still waving about as he tries to balance himself.

“<em>leaves. As requested.</em>” His voice clearly out of breath from that silly little leap.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=waahcry><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=waahcry src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/846869177510658119.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=bigcrai><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=bigcrai src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1067345914714394634.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=crying><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=crying src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1153522462223503441.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=dokis><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=dokis src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/975120182622167111.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=uwu_slammies><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=uwu_slammies src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1149533376043286559.gif loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

He always has been. He&#39;s the first to see when she put on the mask, and he is the one she never takes it off from. But she is somewhat human even underneath those jointed legs, and unnatural skin that takes on the void of something swallowing up stars. She&#39;s bound to slip up. Cendri is the one who advertises the shop, she has to be flashy and put on a good show in return for letting the other take her under his care.

Going down this line of thought was incredibly dangerous, and if Enoch was aware of his mistakes, Cendri certainly was as well. She does not reply to it, withdrawing her grip on his hand for just a moment. But it must have been a slip of the hand, because she goes back to holding on tight. She tilts her head innocently, still ever smiling at him. 

She feels the squeeze, and something cracks inside her. &quot;Don&#39;t slip on the snow. I&#39;ll wait.&quot; She says softly. It was so insignificant, so beneath Enoch&#39;s mastery to be reduced to having to promise a doll that he wouldn&#39;t leave in a toybox for something silly. Rather, there is acceptance of the strings being tied to a display, and framed in a cage because it is the comforting silence she knows. He is exact to the amount of steps he would take away from her, but she doesn&#39;t need such affirmations. It&#39;s ridiculous and the act of a fool, and only Cendri should be playing the part of one. But the toymaker is sincere no matter who he speaks with, and never one to be dishonest even in his actions. It&#39;s a sentiment she is foreign to. 

When he releases her hand, she turns away from him, her unseeing gaze only focused on a distant place that was only known to her. Her head tilts to the sky that does not bless her with its colors, but she remembers what it used to look like. Cendri&#39;s hands extend towards where snowflakes melt instantaneously upon contact with her skin. Snow reminded her a little of rain. The cold is stinging, but not unwelcomed.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1186543851972866140 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1186543851972866140><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, December 18, 2023 10:41 PM">10:41 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Perhaps if she kept breathing in the winter air, she too will become just like wisps of smoke that disappeared. 

That reverie is broken by the disturbance of a sudden loud thud from right next to her, and she startles from the suddenness of sound invading her space. The antennae atop her head still in movements, almost like a cat raising its hairs in shock. Cool air brushes her face from where the other starts flailing to keep himself upright. Cendri blinks several times, as if trying to discern what had happened before she hears Enoch&#39;s voice far too close to her liking. But there&#39;s a quality to it that makes her very much take notice of the raggedness as though he had run a marathon, and the pieces click.

She begins to laugh, her hand moving to press against her face as she shakes in full body tremors. &quot;What...What were you even doing?&quot; She has to start holding her figure, ducking her face out of sight even where her face blossoms red. It starts evolving into coughs.

&quot;You didn&#39;t have to do that.&quot; She remarks, once the laughter subsides and settling into something more quiet. There&#39;s a pause with hesitation. &quot;...Really.&quot; But her face warms and she smiles genuinely to where she supposed his figure was. &quot;Thank you.&quot; There is something there in her gratitude, more to unpack before she quickly moves away from letting him overanalyze it. 

Cendri moves to take the two rotting leaves, browned and crisp as she handles them. The bundle of packed snow that she had in her hands is now being stabbed into by the thin stems of dead leaves. Instead of a snowman, she makes a sad little creature with leafy ears. &quot;It&#39;s me.&quot; She says pushing the ugly snow bunny closer to her face to make a comparison. &quot;Isn&#39;t it cute?&quot; She says jokingly, knowing she likely placed one ear far too up, and one far too down.

Worry and regret beginning to fill the soundless void that surrounded the pair. But by the first shift of her shoulders, and the brush of genuine laughter, Enoch could finally let himself breathe. His knees coming to rest on the edge of the jacket Cendri sat upon as he joined her.

“I wanted to prove my word.” His voice mostly normal now aside a few under tones of breathlessness. 

“you don’t have to thank me…” a cloud of white would escape his lips as he took hold of the pristine treasure that Cendri offered him. In her eyes, she might not be able to see the worth. But, to him, he could see exactly what she was aiming for. Even before she mentioned it aloud. Which, that in itself is a skill few have.

His pinched brows would ease a hint as he stared down at this snowy creation. It’s shape not pristine but, in his eyes it was- “..perfect.” The word mumbled from his mouth as he carefully placed the snowman onto the ground in front of him. Making sure not a single leaf was moved out of place.

His attention would shift momentarily as he too grabs a hand full of snow. Compacting it messily before grabbing a nearby twig. Snapping it to pieces so he could make his <em>own</em> miniature snowman, a pair of misshapen glasses.

“Close enough.” He’d shrug though the faintest twitch of a smile would pull at the corner of his mouth. This was one of the first times he’s created something…and <em>not</em> cared how the results turned out. To do something, just <em>for fun</em>.

His umber gaze would linger for a moment before her turned to offer it towards Cendri. “Now both our self portraits can watch us struggle with this task.”</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1185817559262560359/1187038389380337684/Untitled_Artwork.png?ex=65f1b7a6&amp;is=65df42a6&amp;hm=c255a2575faaa3096ffd3ae6918ed6cddaa46997481c1bbb2dde174096564ec5&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1185817559262560359/1187038389380337684/Untitled_Artwork.png?ex=65f1b7a6&amp;is=65df42a6&amp;hm=c255a2575faaa3096ffd3ae6918ed6cddaa46997481c1bbb2dde174096564ec5&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: Untitled_Artwork.png (3.49 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=waahcry><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=waahcry src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/846869177510658119.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=crai><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=crai src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1079947585424478219.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=bigcrai><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=bigcrai src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1067345914714394634.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=dead><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=dead src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/818015168247103489.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=pdead><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=pdead src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/725699433865412619.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=love><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=love src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/818015333620908072.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=two_hearts><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=💕 src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/1f495.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1187038585078157332 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1187038585078157332><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, December 20, 2023 7:27 AM">7:27 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“so…where shall we start, lead creator?” With the side creations done it was time for the main event.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She liked promises, but she could not keep them herself.

A sense of envy simmered inside her. She squashes the feeling down, keeping the mood intimate and sweet with exchanged smiles.

They shared a space that was close, yet distant somewhat. Cendri does not pay attention to the wall she&#39;s left consciously between them. Instead, she moves her head towards the direction of the frozen lake as he speaks. &quot;You always do. There are a lot of things I should thank you for.&quot; She returns after a while before abruptly deciding to go back to the matter on hand when he removes the scrap of snow from her hand. 

&quot;What was that?&quot; She asks with warmth, where the coincidental draft picks up to drown out his voice. Enoch has always been the quiet type, and never spoke more than necessary. 
There&#39;s the sudden sound of snapping like one had stepped on sticks, and Cendri tilts her head. She doesn&#39;t make stray movements, but if it had been a beast, Enoch would have warned her already. The sounds continue, and she remains seated on his outer coat, blankly waiting.

Oh.

Though she can&#39;t see it, she can sense what Enoch has in his hand as she reaches over for it. It&#39;s shaped much more proportionally accurate to a head than her own, but it is undoubtedly a miniature version of himself. (Or so it seems?) She traces over the rough piece of twig that he had bent to his whims, circling around it to determine the shape of what was meant to be a glasses frame. It&#39;s not perfect by any means, but who ever said that creation needed to be perfect? Even badly written stories come from a place of passion, and flaws were what made talents shine. &quot;You look cute as a snowman.&quot; She smiles, patting the ground where she can place it down gingerly, unknowingly right alongside his. &quot;We&#39;re here to have fun. it doesn&#39;t have to be a dreary affair.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1187276484835037204 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1187276484835037204><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, December 20, 2023 11:12 PM">11:12 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;I think people typically start with the head right? Then you can make the body! We&#39;ll decorate it from there.&quot; She says, but it sounds more as though she were asking herself. Cendri hums lightly and begins to roll snow away in the opposite direction of their miniatures. Compiling snow and compacting it together... she makes a <strong>cube</strong> for a head. Electricity still sparks in the air as though she were trying to find where she had marked her location, only stopping directly to where it reacts to the static from Enoch&#39;s jacket. Her fingers tug lightly on the fabric of what must be dark attire. 

&quot;Come closer,&quot; She whispers lightly, cupping her hand to her mouth where the sleeve&#39;s frilled ends gently brushes past her cheeks. It&#39;s almost said in such a conspiratorial manner despite the fact there is no other soul in sight but the two of them. Perhaps it&#39;s a little foul to know how much Enoch trusts her, and that she knows he would extend himself for her sake. But, those closest to you are always the ones that you leave open to betray you easily. 

Leaving her frozen fingertips is the small pile of snow she had collected without his notice. The tips of her fingertips had changed color, but she wanted to catch Enoch off guard. There isn&#39;t even a warning, just the tilt of her lips into a mawkish smile, and a wicked gleam in her marble eyes as a warning. She had been aiming for where she assumes is his chest, but the snow slams directly into his face. 

She cannot see this.</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1185817559262560359/1187276484566597652/fdsfsdgfdg_1.jpg?ex=65f29564&amp;is=65e02064&amp;hm=c22a66da12765bf8f310ebcfdd84703253d89c88e3615fdc71bf5b8a5afc7005&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1185817559262560359/1187276484566597652/fdsfsdgfdg_1.jpg?ex=65f29564&amp;is=65e02064&amp;hm=c22a66da12765bf8f310ebcfdd84703253d89c88e3615fdc71bf5b8a5afc7005&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: fdsfsdgfdg_1.jpg (179.74 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1187276610265686087 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1187276610265686087><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, December 20, 2023 11:13 PM">11:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She&#39;s found herself in a fit of laughter again. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="icee_u">@Icee | ☕ | &#128293; | &#128218;</span></span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1185817559262560359/1187276610051768380/fdsfsdgfdg_2.jpg?ex=65f29582&amp;is=65e02082&amp;hm=ec33c88eecae5b6b5129e37db0568191dc373f13257c19007bab4ac49a222754&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1185817559262560359/1187276610051768380/fdsfsdgfdg_2.jpg?ex=65f29582&amp;is=65e02082&amp;hm=ec33c88eecae5b6b5129e37db0568191dc373f13257c19007bab4ac49a222754&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: fdsfsdgfdg_2.jpg (202.38 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=hamlove><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=hamlove src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1061958146685407242.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=HAHA><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=HAHA src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1066242398264496138.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=snowflake><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=❄️ src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/2744.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=pdead><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=pdead src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/815695128253562928.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=rolf><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=rolf src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/713971307414421535.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=godty><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=godty src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1102331360380731403.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

“As you say lead maker.” Typically one starts with the body but he would not dare interrupt Cendri’s process over such trivial things. Like she said, they were here for <em>fun</em>. All typical procedures and processes would be thrown out the window for today! Even for him, as he too, starts to form his own part of the snowman. 

As he started to take on his own, ‘creative liberties’, for the snowman’s body, it would catch him by surprise as Cendri’s whispered voice called him closer. Concern knitting his brows as he began to worry if something was a bother. Could she sense the ‘creative take’ he took whilst forming the body of the snowman? Should he have followed typical procedure??? Should he have down the circular structures instead of the <strong>Cursed Seal</strong> body he was forming?

Hands ready to scrape some snow together should the woman Agree to the art of war.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=EcksDeeKirbee><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=EcksDeeKirbee src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/784268757270921267.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=rolf><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=rolf src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/713971307414421535.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=dokis><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=dokis src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/975120182622167111.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=🫶><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=🫶 src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/1faf6.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

After all, if Enoch had said it was unimportant, she had no desire to poke the beehive. The additions of their makeshift snow selves watching them is a strange comfort to her, like a mother to her children. There&#39;s a familiarity to it, like the toys that sat quietly lined up on the shelves as she worked in the shop in Dreto. Although they hadn&#39;t arrived here too long ago, only to meet the first snowfall in Raehn, she had begun to reminisce about the shop they had left behind. She would not voice this though, for she knows how important this journey is to Enoch.

It&#39;s a little odd to be referred to in such a way when she was the <em>self proclaimed assistant</em> to the true owner of the workshop. He, who creates miracles from his gifted hands, carves each doll and toy model with a finesse that cannot be compared to her clumsy attempts at what could be considered ridicule on the craft. 

Enoch&#39;s toys are carved with an uncanny perfect symmetry that could not be matched up to another, but remained deprived of the life he wished them to have. But to her, there was always a sense to know something was made with flaws, for they were not gods. Life should be a taboo to be given and freely taken away by mortal hands. She&#39;d prefer the feeling of a stray splinter where her nail presses against a misshapen piece of wood, a material that had not been sanded down properly so the surface would still be rough... She preferred Enoch&#39;s imperfections over the crushing anxieties of holding up to that standard.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1195628311938871318 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1195628311938871318><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, January 13, 2024 12:20 AM">12:20 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Truthfully, Cendri would not be able to notice his semi-deformed snowman at all. If she doesn&#39;t touch it, she could not feel the shape. She pats at it gently, only focused on the shape of the square head being attached to their half... sideways snowman who seemed to be a large whale with the large lump in his body.

Enoch&#39;s voice is soft, always said with care as though he were trying not to frighten off a small animal in his vicinity. It&#39;s pleasant, but it does not stop her from ambushing him. There&#39;s a sputter, like someone had choked, and it&#39;s then Cendri realizes she had likely hit him in the face <img

It goes quiet, and for a second Cendri feels as though she is on her lonesome in the snowfield, empty and devoid of time and space. It&#39;s enough to make her kneel down. The sudden sounds of laughter allows her to see again, clearly like the sky overhead. &quot;Ah.&quot; She says, her expression unapologetic and sheepish. &quot;Enoch, are you alright?&quot; She smiles uneasily, reaching over as if she were searching for something. Her sleeves find purchase with his cheeks, brushing aside the coolness from where it had landed.

That identity gives her pause, like she hadn&#39;t considered the thought. Though she was from the sea, it had been a very long time since she had seen it. Years of being on land disconnected her from the memories of a warm family&#39;s embrace, and the never ending abyss of the trenches where dark waters lie stagnant. 

She waves a finger into the air in a singular motion, almost the slightest bit smug. &quot;If that&#39;s how you see it.&quot; She says, making space between them as though she anticipated his retaliation. Even without seeing, she can hear what borders between amusement, and mischief in Enoch&#39;s tone.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1195628568953225336 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1195628568953225336><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, January 13, 2024 12:21 AM">12:21 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Then let&#39;s have a war.&quot; Distracted from their task at hand, she gets up, preparing herself to pack more snow into her hands.

His eyes had been closed to the world, unknowing of the gentle touch before it graced his skin.

Umber eyes would fling open in surprise. His once chilled to the touch skin, slowly finding warmth from the faint touch. Even though fabric separated their contact, just that gentle warmth, was enough to chip away the numb that dared to take hold. “<em>I am fine.</em>” He’d whisper, almost sounding as if his breath had been stolen from his very lungs. He should had lead with that. He would condemn himself for not doing so sooner. Those blessed with sight would have been able to tell..but with Cendri…he just…he should have been more considerate.

But just as the air of worry had shrouded him, the tables would turn just as fast. The mentions of his playful ‘war’ casted into the air yet again. But this time, as Cendri readied herself for such a silly venture, one simple step, would turn into a tumble. One that would caused Enoch’s chest to fall just as swift.

“<em>Cendri?</em>” it would be clear in his tone how concerned he suddenly became. Snow crunching but a few paces away as he stumbled to reach Cendri’s fallen form. “<em>Cendri??</em>” Enoch would continue to plea her name even when he hovered just overhead. Maintaining just enough distance as to not suffocate her personal space, but close enough to ensure she maintained no injuries.

“Y-you are not injured…are you?” A gloved hand would lift, and hover just above her concealed expression, waiting. Waiting to hear her next words to guide his movements. For he would not dare breach her comfort unless absolutely necessary.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Feeling for a loss at words, her breath had stopped too. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t ever get hurt because of me.&quot;
The closeness of his breath is carefully noted, but there is no urge to lean in to seal a promise. There is just the feeling of two people alone in the world, intertwined by strings and leaning on despair&#39;s incarnations to gain some semblance of normality to move forward once more. A toxic dependency. Like a flower that had blossomed open, with each petal curling towards Enoch as though vulnerability was being given towards the sun. But, she shutters just as quickly, turning her head back up to the void of sky. Warmth brushes her cheeks as she exhales.

Bricks are carefully put back piece by piece, once again finding their position to be along an indescribable reality, a distance that could not be measured. &quot;You don&#39;t always have to feel bad for me.&quot; She says quietly, wondering how far his guilt goes and why it extends to her. 

Her fall is a convenient distraction. One that allows her a brief lapse in time, and judgement.

&quot;Nope.&quot; She says with a swipe of her sleeves tucking away snow in one fluid motion and tossing it up into the air where she assumes he lingers. &quot;Fooled you again, Enoch! Really, you can&#39;t let your guard down.&quot; She says, getting up from her place, shaking out the snow that found a home in her hair. She runs her fingers through midnight locks slowly, like a comb brushing to create the sleekness of her hair.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1196713734287130744 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1196713734287130744><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, January 16, 2024 12:13 AM">12:13 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Cendri smiles brightly, tucking her hands behind her back.

They will pretend they didn&#39;t see anything, no trailing marks left upon her face as they always did. A game of house solely to indulge the two of them who don&#39;t have the right to such luxuries at all. &quot;I&#39;m okay, let&#39;s... go back to building our snowman. I&#39;m sorry for tricking you.&quot; She says with a hint of honesty in her voice despite it being something she&#39;s weaponized long ago. Cendri turns back to the pile of snow that she&#39;s likely made a mess of, with how inconsistent the shapes were, her inclined head in focus towards what she can <em>see</em> rather than what she would rather not be able to sense. Reading feelings was like asking her to find her way home in a forest without having navigated it once. Shrouded by tall trees, but instead trying to understand her companion&#39;s abyss of emotions. A box that she digs her hand into from time to time, but never able to discern what comes out of it. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="icee_u">@Icee | ☕ | &#128293; | &#128218;</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Was she not warm enough? He’d ponder, hands dusting the cloak free of any lingering snow. 

“Is that what I do?” He’d answer in a stoic tone. “Because to me, feeling bad, and watching out for those close to you, are two separate meanings.” With a careful motion of his hands, Enoch would drape his fur lined cloak over the mermaids shoulders. He may not have been blessed with strength over the years but, with this small gesture, he could at least provide the smallest bit of protection for Cendri. Even if the thing he was protecting her from, was merely a bit of flurried snow. 

But no one, not even he, would have wondered… Who would protect <em>himself</em> from such a frost bitten enemy? Such a thought might have been useful to think about, <em>before</em> yet another handful was sent flying into his face. 

Yet again Enoch would be rendered speechless. Snow slowly sliding from his features as he straightened his frame. 

<em>Did she really-</em>

Another smile would threaten his composure. Hand coming to brush away the snow that prickled at his skin. “I suppose I should…” He really <em>should</em> have seen that coming. Especially when he’s lived with Cendri, and her antics for all this time. But, even so, such antics kept him on his toes. And such antics…honestly? Made life a bit more, enticing to see what comes next.

With another sweep of his hand, the final bits of snow would be removed, along with the quiver that dare to up turn his lip.

“Your tricks keep me on my toes.” He’d admit. Tone gaining a softer lull as he returned his attention towards their snowy creation. 

Now what was usually next when creating such snow figures?

With delicate fingers, Enoch would brush some snow from the earth and reveal two budded daisies beneath. “Flowers-“ He’d mutter, carefully plucking each one from the earth before placing it upon the snowman.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1197729000991248464 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1197729000991248464><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, January 18, 2024 7:27 PM">7:27 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“For its eyes.

The jacket resting on her shoulders is a cover from not just the cold, but her very existence from the world. &quot;Enoch! I really don&#39;t need it-&quot; She protests, after snuggling into the oversized coat. &quot;You&#39;re going to get sick.&quot; For her. Enoch was truly a soul that the world had done wrong. She reaches over to pull off the hat that covers her antennae for him like some sort of exchange.

Perhaps it was a punishment for his lacking self preservation. Trusting her was a mistake! She&#39;s always been a prankster, someone who pulls out performances like a magician with a hat.

She lets herself break into a grin, red fingers burned by the snow pressing to her cheeks. &quot;And you make it too easy for me to do so.&quot;

As always, she listens carefully to the very earth itself, the air rippling around her, and the call of the skies. Enoch&#39;s voice is her anchor, a guide to the unknown to where he mentions his next course of action.
Cendri is stunned momentarily at what Enoch finds for the snowman&#39;s eyes. She had not anticipated there to be any flowers remaining from the winter blanket that had started descending from the sky. But she doesn&#39;t reach over to <em>see</em> what Enoch had placed onto its face, in fear her touch would taint the rare petals. Instead, she smiles at the thought, the conjured image she makes in her head.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1201776335421460580 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1201776335421460580><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, January 29, 2024 11:30 PM">11:30 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>For a flower, it would not survive being plucked, would not see through the winter to be able to thrive fully. But she does not voice this. She worries if she does, a future may not happen at all. The doll knows that her creator is just like a flower, and she should not bruise it with her hold. 

&quot;May it come to see our endeavors in this land to come for the new spring together.&quot; She says, like a prayer. Her frozen hands have managed to dig something out. It&#39;s... hard, but not as stiff like a rock. There&#39;s a root like shape to it, but she can&#39;t manage to understand what she&#39;s pulled from the snow. Perhaps it&#39;d be best on the face? It would make for a good sharp nose. She gently pats around where the head should be, before stabbing it lopsidedly into its unimpressive body. &quot;Now it has something to smell good food with. How does it look, Enoch?&quot; She asks innocently.  <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="icee_u">@Icee | ☕ | &#128293; | &#128218;</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>
