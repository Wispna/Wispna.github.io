He watched with the dancer with a small frown, realizing that not a single dance here had yet been Wafetian elvish. He&#39;d tried so hard to remember the steps to those, and for what. He mournfully ate a grape, and did his best to remember each step and movement.

She had tired of mingling, despite being quite alone as events like these were not her preference to attend. But she is more than aware this was...necessary, if even just to socialize amongst the fellow marked. She lets out a breathless sigh, inspecting for a place to find a brief moment of reverie. With that, she sees a single figure sitting next to an elaborate table and an empty chair next to him, and chooses to approach to get some rest for dainty ankles bound by the straps of heels. 
 
&quot;Hello. May I sit here?&quot; Comes a whimsical voice that sounds like velvet, yet combined with a strangely melodic element like a whale&#39;s song under water. 

Donning a silk veil that looked as though it had been spun by a delicate spider&#39;s web, and a headdress of navy feathers that gently accentuate the colors of her attire, neatly in contrast to the whites. She pushes the translucent fabric aside with consideration, enough to unveil pristine white locks lovingly caressed by a familiar dark blue ribbon. Peering from a delicately framed face are unusually soft and warm eyes unlike the powder snow she resembled. Perhaps it was more accurate to say that tonight, she resembled the moonlight glowing amongst the stars, painted along a deep midnight blue. The sheen of her wings tonight is a shade of cobalt, glossy in its feathers and smooth to not even indicate dye. Ribbon laces drape themselves over unnecessarily across their wings, the ends of stars tied to their ends.

Freyr doesn&#39;t seem all too surprised to see the face is familiar, her expression in that same amicable smile she always wears. &quot;Oh, aren&#39;t you... Imrafeinn?&quot; She says, tone soft and whispery as if she didn&#39;t want anyone to overhear from nosy eavesdroppers. &quot;You look quite nice today.&quot; They say politely, taking note of his own attire. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="wispna">@worm mother</span></span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=flushed><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=ðŸ˜³ src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/1f633.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

He looked again at their wings, his head hurting as they seemed to shimmer from blue to floral. He glanced away for a moment, then his eyes widened as he realized. &quot;...You&#39;re lying,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&#39;t realize before but I do now. You aren&#39;t what you pretend to be.&quot; 

He ignored the comment about his attire, not interested in small talk.

Her smile mildly falters briefly, so quick that it disappeared in a single blink of the eyes. Under the scrutiny of Imrafeinn&#39;s overbearing sight, she continues to uphold that unfathomable mask. An all-seeing gaze that seemed to want to take ahold of his soul, yet cradle it in a way that protects it from the world.

&quot;I didn&#39;t lie.&quot; She says gently, lips turned upwards as though she means to laugh. She did not sound offended at all by his accusation. &quot;When we first met, I told you my blood wasn&#39;t the purest.&quot; That had been an honest truth. He had merely assumed her form the minute he saw her wings. 
Did that mean his innate magic sense had gotten stronger? How peculiar... but it mattered no longer to her. It may have been better this way if people knew beforehand. She tilts her head, &quot;Less questions are asked this way, don&#39;t you think?&quot; There&#39;s a small hint of bitterness in her voice, as though the emotions had involuntarily seeped in. She seems small, fragile like glass, but her gaze is steady when she looks back up towards him.

&quot;It is...nice to be seen for what I am.&quot; She replies quietly, her hands folding in her lap as she makes to sit down. Her actions are impeccably controlled, due to the minute motions of how she sits. her dress does not make to touch the ground, and she does not cross her legs to indicate haughtiness. Upright, regal, and all the posture of someone with a background in etiquette, knowing exactly how to conduct herself in such a setting. She observes the ballroom floor without a word, but what her focus was on... no one but Freyr would know. &quot;And why are you here alone?&quot; She questions without turning to look at him.

He ate a tiny piece of crisp bread laden with cured ham, goat cheese, and fig jam, blinking at the taste, then reaching for another. 

&quot;And I get why you do it,&quot; he said after swallowing. &quot;I&#39;d do the same if I was ashamed of what I was. Not your fault though. That belongs to your idiot parents.&quot;

Were these all things to say to cover up that he didn&#39;t have a dance partner? She decides to be cautious in how to approach the topic, wondering if it were sensitive. In a way that lowers herself, so she does not tread on his pride... &quot;Oh- that&#39;s a shame.&quot; The halfblood smiles warmly towards him, fingers twisting around snowy locks shyly. &quot;I actually... wanted to dance with someone. If you&#39;re not welcome to company, I would hate to bother you then.&quot; 

Freyr doesn&#39;t seize up like she thinks she will on the topic of her existence. She may have done so before but she couldn&#39;t recall when... It&#39;s been too long to dwell on something that she has long accepted is in the past. She recognizes that she breathes just as normal, like a wind that had simply passed. She purses her lips carefully to speak as though picking out each term selectively without giving much away. &quot;...I haven&#39;t been told that before.&quot; She hesitates, blinking several times in curiosity. 

No one had ever told her that before. People often pointed fingers at her first, because it was her very birth that became tangible evidence of an illicit entanglement between a noble and something else. It&#39;s odd that she finds herself... lacking of words lately. Perhaps because of the hopelessness and discontent that had been brewing inside of her since the start of the party. What else could she say in spite of a single phrase. &quot;Thank you for understanding.&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="wispna">@worm mother</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

When they had first met, Imrafeinn&#39;s melody resembled something dissonant, loud chords that sounded like someone angrily slamming down on an instrument. His tune here is relatively softer, like tentative piano keys descending into a light scale. Was it more comfortable to know he was speaking to a halfblood from sympathy? Or was his dislike for birds just all that great? 

She is surprised when he offers his hand towards her, her hands poised midair as though she were uncertain. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; Freyr chides gently. She doesn&#39;t wish to make him uncomfortable after all and feigns ignorance. But she smiles, the lightest touch of a hand meeting his in place. &quot;I would be honored.&quot; Her white and blue gown rises with her as she leaves the chair, her heels clicking when they press onto marble floor.

The little comment makes her giggle as well. &quot;Perhaps they may cry.&quot; She smiles, &quot;I believe I never properly introduced myself. I am Freyr, sir.&quot; As always, a dance starts with an introduction, then a proper greeting midway between a bow and a curtsy. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="wispna">@worm mother</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Oh dear... she should have better explained how to properly conduct ones self before initiating the dance. <img

Something unpleasant overcomes her, her composure holding itself together. &quot;I see.

Freyr claims Imrafeinn&#39;s hand once again, touch so ghostly that it was almost as though she was never there. Then her feet follow almost all too naturally to press forward, carefully in a manner so she does not step on his feet. &quot;Are you worried, Sir Imrafeinn? Please don&#39;t be.

He didn&#39;t like it when people seemed to extend too much empathy, too much care to him alone. Was it the pressure, or simply the feeling of needing to hold onto an image? 

She feigns ignorance, and moves her other feet forward, then to the side and back again in rhythmic steps. Their height difference is notable when he stands tall enough to loom over her. Her hands are small in his, and they are grateful her heels allow them to reach his shoulder.

Why he asks... A memory of cathedral halls, and a black mink whispering to her shoulder sears itself in her mind.
&quot;I suppose I&#39;m not liked.&quot; She says with a smile, melancholy written not in the slight tilt of rosy lips, nor the way her brows barely even furrow in thought. It was in the strange way she looked at him, a type of desperate swirling desolation. Wanted, in a way someone would desire to covet a possession, but never seen or looked past if there was even a hint of a flaw on her being. &quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot; She reassures, gently in a melodic tone following the orchestral strings.

He wordlessly followed her guidance, his pride not making him try and forcefully take the lead. &quot;I wasn&#39;t waiting for someone,&quot; he said. &quot;I realized there wasn&#39;t anyone I wanted to subject myself to an entire evening with.

I was told I could ask them for a favor instead.&quot; She says quietly, eyes never once leaving the elf. &quot;The townsfolk are kind indeed.&quot;

Freyr&#39;s dress flows in a way that it looked more like a wave out at sea, tides rising and falling with the call of the moon. She returns back to her initial position, and gently steers Imrafeinn&#39;s hand&#39;s, taking careful note of his feet, making certain not to lead him in a way he may slip up. It was better to have faith in the motions of her partner, and being considerate. &quot;You must not be fond of places like this.&quot; She says with sympathy, understanding in her eyes. &quot;Do you... like the town?&quot; Would he want to return to Raehn, or if he had the chance, would he return to his homeland?

Her eyes are warm, bright like a burst of spring was reflected in them. &quot;What do you like, Sir Imrafeinn? It can be a hobby or anything else.&quot; She inquires softly, her voice becoming a slight hum as she imitates the music being played. A melody that caressed a person&#39;s being, like a breeze under the shade of a tree where the sunlight dances on skin. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="wispna">@worm mother</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His feet began to find the steps more naturally. Dancing wasn&#39;t unlike swordplay, and he&#39;d always had a light step. &quot;I think Raehn is my best option right now. It&#39;s not the best, and I think it&#39;s doomed to fail. It hardly compares to the glory of Shenedorei, but it&#39;s small enough to not have the rot of Alorin festering deep within.

The halfblood doesn&#39;t miss a single step despite her vision being clearly clouded with thought. &quot;If I had counted every little thing, I am certain they would be in debt.&quot; A melodic sound escapes her lips with clarity. &quot;...It&#39;s... a little sad to know how much value someone places on you.&quot; Even as her tone becomes something more wistful, with a desperate type of yearning, her eyes keep themselves on Imrafeinn&#39;s visage, reflecting his image in gentle hues.

They notice that his feet have become more effortless, and she relinquishes control over the dance. Freyr allows herself to be led, her steps tapping to signal where she means to stand next, and her wings slightly spread to give them both the space away from other dancers. &quot;What is worrying you about the town?&quot; She asks with concern directed solely towards the elf, but she is a little aware of what is to come. Disaster always seemed to follow the marked. &quot;It&#39;s wonderful to get to explore a hobby.&quot; She says, returning to their initial position of gently holding his hand when she turns once more. 

She does blink owlishly when he asks her instead, not expecting this turn of curiosity. &quot;Ah...&quot; A rise of laughter escapes her lips. Has anyone asked her that before either? No one had taken any of her interests to heart, always having assumed her entire role as a person had simply been a caretaker to a lonely cathedral. She was unsure if the elf had any vested interest in her, or if he was simply asking for polite conversation. However, she wanted to answer someone who had her in their mind for even a moment.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1219159977868918845 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1219159977868918845><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 17, 2024 11:46 PM">11:46 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;I... like to sing, to the smallest sparrows nestled in the trees.&quot; Though that much was a given, but she wanted to be able to sing without a need or purpose for it.

&quot;I actually like to bake, but I can&#39;t guarantee the taste all the time.&quot; Since Freyr had always refused to indulge herself in partaking too much in luxuries.

He turned quickly. &quot;As for the town, well... it&#39;s just destined to fail. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s plenty that want to crush it, and as soon as a few secrets get out...&quot; He shrugged.

He listened patiently to her hobbies, nodding along. &quot;Sparrows? Do they actually like that, or do you just not have friends? Sure, I wouldn&#39;t mind a song or two-- not like I can find much back there anyway. Baking is also good. Useful.&quot;

When she was out of use, she&#39;d simply be just another pawn on the board. Friend or Not.
&quot;I will... deeply consider it. Thank you for your kind advice, and being angry on my behalf.&quot; She replies gently.

She wasn&#39;t quite sure she could bring herself down to that level, but the sentiment itself was touching. It almost sounded as though someone truly was concerned for her, even if she couldn&#39;t quite place the underlying motive behind it. Sympathy? Pity of her precarious state? Whichever it was, they were things she had never been told before.

&quot;... I worry for the state of the town as well.&quot; She murmurs with honesty, brows furrowing slightly when she thinks on it. Secrets... everyone had something they would never tell another because of the skeletons they had to hide. She too, was a person full of them, from her identity to everything else that she was. Even if it had been an unwitting fate, one must simply accept the circumstances. &quot;There are always those who want to seize it, both outside and inside for their own delusions.&quot; Her eyes flicker away, as though she were looking for something in the crowd.

Contrary to how he had treated her earlier, Imrafeinn bore a certain gentleness when he spoke with them. Careful in the sense that he didn&#39;t look for anything to shame, nor anything to pick apart despite such a mundane topic of choice for a conversation. 

&quot;They can sing back to me and I don&#39;t have to worry about making it into a funerary dirge.&quot; She smiles. As that seemed to be people&#39;s favorite request of service from her.

She inclines her head to let white locks fall over her shoulder questioningly. But she doesn&#39;t push it, focused on the idea that the elf would allow her to even sing in his presence. Although Freyr was more humble about her abilities, she had confidence that he&#39;d enjoy the display.

&quot;Do you enjoy tea, Sir Imrafeinn? Pastries go wonderfully with tea and sugar.&quot; A subtle invite for two. &quot;That is, if you don&#39;t tire of my company after the first few visits.&quot; She hums, letting herself to twirl once more.

Maybe she was still a silly fool to think people could be capable of change. Yet, she wipes the slate clean to allow for a fresh start.

&quot;People call me the ghost of the cathedral.&quot; She says wistfully. Or perhaps it had been a rumor spread by someone who called her a friend. &quot;But Sir Imrafeinn seems to hold a reputation that exceeds beyond my reach.&quot; <img

&quot;Those names are unfamiliar to me.&quot; Freyr blinks, lowering her voice to speak softly. &quot;Just you, and whoever stops by the cathedral from time to time. But I will take note of them.&quot; In a way, Imrafeinn had just introduced her to people she assumes are amicable, agreeable to her presence. 

Wasn&#39;t this a form of kindness in itself despite the sharp daggers in his words?

They go silent, contemplation written on her expression. How did she feel about showing off wings that molted petals, flowers instead of feathers weaving through bone?  
Was there a necessary need to disguise herself as they did now? When he had been the first to see through what she had so desperately tried to hide? &quot;Only sometimes.&quot; She says, taking small steps so she does not step on him by accident. &quot;I hope you can understand.&quot; Freyr glances his way, her usual composure on her face even if it seems void of true joy.

&quot;I&#39;ll speak with them if I have the chance. The introduction was kind.&quot; She says, knowing she were likely to come across them given what she&#39;d likely have to do in the future.

Tyrants... It is difficult when much of her life has been under the control of another, always suffocating her to the end. Essentially, Imrafeinn has asked Freyr to extend their trust towards him, no masks to veil false identities, but to face him with raw sincerity. It&#39;s an audacious request, with no basis on reason as to his reliability. The reassurance he would not just expose her to the world, lacking a net for control of flightless wings. She doesn&#39;t know him, but he doesn&#39;t know her either.

She places a still heart in his hands anyways. A single chance. An opportunity to prove her wrong. As she always foolishly does with the hope people will be better than what she thinks of them. Just once.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1221681433773346856 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1221681433773346856><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 24, 2024 10:45 PM">10:45 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;I agree to your terms.&quot; She says with a laugh. The music seems to be coming closer to an end, a building diminuendo coming to gently cushion their dance. The strings themselves slow, and Freyr makes only mild steps now. &quot;Should I expect an invitation anytime soon, Sir Imrafeinn?&quot; She bats her lashes innocently. She wasn&#39;t certain where he lived after all, and she had no suitable place to host him in unless he was particularly religious.

Or if you think it&#39;s too busy, there are places near the lake that are hidden from prying eyes.&quot;

As the song drifted to its end, Imrafeinn released Freyr&#39;s hand, and gave his best imitation of a courtly bow. &quot;I trust you&#39;ll know what&#39;s best.&quot;

Though she was never one to force another into coercion for religious beliefs.

She muses over it. &quot;It is a little busier nowadays. I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t like so many visitors coming in and out.&quot; Freyr says carefully. Considering Imrafeinn was picky with his choice of company, it was much safer to find a place uninterrupted for both himself and them. Streiya, help her if a Feroxi came along, or just someone that had heavy tension with the elf. She worried she&#39;d be cleaning blood out of the carpets in the cathedral instead of tea. Freyr resists the urge to have her hands clap together in a signature pose to indicate excitement. They must uphold their posture. &quot;Then the lake would be a lovely place to visit.&quot; She muses.

They gently take their hand back, wrapped in the folds of their dress. She inclines her head, and curtsies for a final time as her legs cross over from under her gown. &quot;I thank you for leaving the decision to me. It was a pleasure sharing this dance with you, Sir Imrafeinn.&quot; The halfblood smiles, lifting her eyes to meet his. &quot;I hope you&#39;ll receive me warmly there when I arrive.&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="wispna">@worm mother</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though she did not know he would so openly reveal his beliefs, she was pleased with it all the same. To her, there was no need for secrecy in who you prayed to when it came to the divine, and it spoke a lot about the person as well.
Gramhara wasn&#39;t too common of a choice, in comparison to Alorel, and Fakian she has noticed... She should make a census of this so she may better accommodate others for a place to worship. 

&quot;Of course.&quot; She says with a smile, her fingertips gently pressing together with a gentle smile. &quot;Then, I shall wait for your invitation.&quot; She waits for Imrafeinn to part ways with her, before ultimately finding her gaze to land on the glamorous chandeliers. The golden hall filled with bustling people, and perfumes permeating the air to assault the senses. Freyr lets out a breathless sigh as if bracing herself.

And she too, leaves with the same regality of a lone figure with the world upon her back.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=flushed><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=ðŸ˜³ src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/1f633.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>
