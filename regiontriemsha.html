                    <p><strong>Races:</strong> 50% human, 30% Feroxi (many reptilian Feroxi find solace here), 20% everything else. All who dwell here are small out of necessity to survive.</p>

                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Triem Sha is a hot and sandy desert region. It is sparsely populated, home to more predators than people. Most of its population lives near the coastline in tight knit towns, designed intentionally with cramped architecture to keep said predators out. There is less of a formal government in Triem Sha and more a pecking order based on clout. Aside from being famous for everything trying to kill you in this region, Triem Sha is also famous for its rare and delicious cuisine.</p>

                    <p><strong>Region Name:</strong> Triem Sha</p>
                    <p><strong>Capital/Notable Cities:</strong> Forra Tia - The capital. Located on the Shore in the northern part of the region. </p>
                    <p><strong>Government Type:</strong> There is no formal government in Triem Sha but rather a pecking order based on clout. Those who are respected are usually those who have the most impressive battle scars. Reputation goes a long way in Triem Sha, both negative and positive.</p>
                    <p><strong>Population:</strong> Small</p>
                    <p><strong>Population Type:</strong> 50% human, 30% Feroxi (many reptilian Feroxi find solace here), 20% everything else. All who dwell here are small out of necessity to survive.</p>
                    <p><strong>Primary God:</strong> Solq</p>
                    <p><strong>Other Popular Gods</strong> Bao-rha, Fakian, Luwaria</p>
                    <p><strong>Major Landscapes:</strong> Desert, with a large oasis in the west. The west border is composed of large rocky cliffs and mountains where rocs nest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Major Resources:</strong> Monster parts, clay and minerals, pottery.</p>
                    <p><strong>General Climate:</strong> Desert climate- hot days and cold nights. Dry with limited rainfall.</p>
                    <p><strong>Influence Over the World:</strong> Nonexistent. The people of Triem Sha are usually caught up enough in their own lives that the region doesn’t bother much with others.</p>

                    <p><strong>How the rest of Tiranthe views them:</strong> Most regions see Triem Sha as a place for fugitives and low-lifes. The accomplishments of Triem Sha are seldom respected, and most of Tiranthe ignorantly imagines the area to be primitive and archaic.</p>
                    <p><strong>Issues this country faces:</strong> Predators. Harsh weather. Limited resources. A lack of government/social institutions.</p>
                    <p><strong>What’s the economy like?:</strong> Not good. Triem Sha has no official currency of its own and outside currency is seldom honored or accepted by most residents in the area as it is seen as fundamentally useless. Those who hold onto currency usually do so for the sake of merchants and travellers who occasionally stop by the more popular cities of the region. For the most part, though, people trade and barter for what they need- trading favors and promises of ‘i owe you one’ when they lack anything else to offer.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What are the main languages spoken?:</strong> Common, Feroxi</p>
                    <p><strong>Where do most people live?:</strong> By the coasts.</p>
                    <p><strong>How does this country view magic?:</strong> Positively as another tool for survival. </p>
                    <p><strong>How technologically advanced is this country? Is magic preferred?:</strong> Between magic and technology the mindset of the region is whatever works, works. In Triem Sha, people aren’t too picky about the means if the results are good.The plumbing and irrigation in Triem Sha is one area that is extremely effective and efficient. The housing as well is built to last, and buildings are well ventilated to manage the high temperatures, while remaining structurally sound.</p>
                    <p>
                      Much of the continent’s most durable and lightweight survival gear originates from Triem Sha’s craftsmen, who know how to use each part of predator carcasses to their full potential.</p>
                    <p><strong>How is history recorded?:</strong>  It’s not. Sometimes history passes orally. If you’re lucky, you’ve heard some stories that are more truth than fiction.</p>
                    <p><strong>How many are educated, and how?:</strong> Most are educated in the ways of survival, but formal education on impractical things is seen as a waste of time. Books are hard to come by, and anything important enough to understand is usually depicted in diagrams, so many do not know how to read.</p>
                    <p><strong>How did the majority of current people come to be on this land?:</strong> Most remain here because they were born here, although the region sometimes attracts outcasts from other regions who are attracted to the seemingly lawless lands.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why do people choose to live here?:</strong> Many find the freedom to live as they choose liberating, as Triem Sha, despite all of its struggles, is a place where each person is considered equal to their neighbor.</p>
                    <p><strong>How popular is the government?:</strong> If the most influential person/group in any given town is hated enough, people generally band together to get rid of them.</p>
                    <p><strong>How are criminals charged and punished?:</strong> If you get away with a crime and karma doesn’t get you back for it, good for you. Just be careful, as the innocent barkeep or street vendor might have unknown allies that will step up for them when wronged. Justice is taken into one’s own hands in Triem Sha, and if you cross the wrong person, you’ll surely regret it.</p>
