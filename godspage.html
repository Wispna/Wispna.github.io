                            <p>The goddess of justice and mercy</p>
                            <p>​Throughout mythology, she was often portrayed as a god who cared more for mortal struggles and honorable deeds, answering prayers when life seemed to be at its darkest. It is not unusual to see hospitals or orphanages built in her name.</p>

                            <p>The god of sun, deserts, and hope.</p>
                            <p>Solq is related with hope and joy, often prayed to in times of celebration which adds to the consistency of him being depicted in play, song, and dance. Although this imagery does not sway his importance as the ever present, reliable sun. Many travelers leave feathers as offering to appease him before crossing large desert stretches.</p>
                            <p>A common legend states that if you collect a feather from each and every kind of bird and place their feathers at his temples, Solq will grant you a single wish.</p>

                            <p>The goddess of water, the moon, and knowledge</p> 
                            <p>There are many rumors that this goddess was originally alien to this world, as she embodies the moon. Much like the ocean, vast and mysterious, Luwaria seems to be more than meets the eye. Luwaria is a merciful force, having saved those devoted to the ocean long ago from drowning in the sea. Most come to her for a sense of resolution and inner peace, as she seemingly has the solution to all of their problems. People who follow this goddess typically share the sentiment that there is a solution to any problem, but it just isn’t seen yet.</p>

                            <p>Originally a member of the four major gods, Sindariel was outcast as the black sheep of the family when she gained dominion over death. It is claimed that Sindariel exists as a living goddess by possessing the body of a mortal to rule over Selpharas. Her followers claim that she is reincarnated every cycle in a new host.</p>
                            <p>Worshippers of The Silent One believe death to be natural and the next step in the cycle of existence. The most devout followers of Sindariel are sent on pilgrimages around the world to act as reapers. They aid those who are ready to enter the next stage of the cycle and end needless suffering.</p>

                        <p>As the Goddess of Nature and Creation, Saiphina is associated with the boom of growth and innovation. Businesses, farmers, hunters, inventors, students and even artists pray to her in hopes of seeing bounty and inspiration fall into their laps. It is said however that her blessings never come without a cost, and that when winter comes she takes what she considers hers. It is unknown if there is truth in this myth or if it is just a lesson to teach children to be frugal and prepare for times less plenty. ​</p>
                        <p>It is said one should never pray to her during the snowy months lest she lash out in rage for being disturbed during her time of grieving over her children who’d perished in the fall. On the very coldest and darkest day of winter it is customary to leave the pit of a fruit on your doorstep, in hopes that blossoms will decorate your gardens come spring. ​</p>

It is unknown where the Keeper resides, and their depictions are vague and uncertain, even from those who were taken under the Keeper’s wing in their childhood. ​ ​ ​</p>
