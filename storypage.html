        <p>At first it was a raindrop.</p>
        <p>A clergyman suffocated while sleeping; a senator disappeared, washed up in the river a week later. It was a slow trickle of suspicious deaths that spanned the continent and gained momentum, bringing an unfamiliar feeling of dread that wedged itself into the hearts of society’s high ranked and privileged.</p>
        <p><em>A divine punishment for the wicked,</em> some whispered.</p>
        <p><em>No, the work of an evil cult,</em> others declared.</p>
        <p>...whatever it was, persisted. At first it was a raindrop, and then it stormed.</p>
        <p>The priestess in all her sacred divinity should have been untouchable. No one could have imagined a day where her mortality was tested. But on the day the priestess was found murdered, as mortal as anyone else in the end despite all her sacred holiness, Tiranthe stilled, and wept.</p>
        <p>...and then raged.</p>
        <p>For in her last breaths she had left behind a hope for people to cling to: a clue in the form of a symbol, scrawled onto the floor where she bled.</p>
        <p>In less than a day’s time Andaras made a formal declaration. In the name of Alorel, and every good force in the land, they swore: <em>We will not sit idle. We have been given the sign we need to put a stop to whoever, or whatever, is responsible!</em> ...and every prophet, politician, and monarch across the land followed suit in a pact, and a promise, to not let The Priestess’ sacrifice go wasted-- to not let evil go unpunished.</p>
        <p>(Unfortunately, that’s where you come in.)</p>

        <p>It hasn’t been long since the mark showed up mysteriously on your body, but it feels long enough-- before any suspicious murders or dead idols painted a target on you and before your dreams started feeling less and less like your own. You didn’t kill The Priestess, you think you know that much.</p>
        <p>In the end you realize it’s not just you- there’s a growing group of strangers all with the same suspicion and the same fate.</p>
        <p>Regardless of innocence, regardless of guilt, all those suspected are taken to Raehn. The tarnished old city has been abandoned for centuries now, but it’s a good enough home for a group of suspected murderers.</p>
        <p>It’s good enough for you.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4 class="poiret">The Beginning</h4>
        <p>The marked are brought as prisoners to Raehn. There they meet the 5 head Guards, Edgar from the Andaran royal faction who leads the rest, Cygnus from Selpharas, Valerius from the Andaran holy faction, Kael from Scatha, and Shikra from Yuani. They also meet the peculiar hermit of Raehn, Satchel, who said he has lived in this cursed, abandoned city for years. Satchel is willing to help the prisoners and sell them contraband in exchange for the crystal birds that can be found scattered around Raehn.</p>
        <p>Without much else to do, the marked start to rebuild the fallen city. Since it keeps the prisoners mostly out of trouble, the guards allow it, though not without occasionally making a move to beat the prisoners into fear and submission. As the marked grow more familiar with the city, they realize that there are many odd magical happenings in Raehn, peculiar symbols on objects, and in particular are strange dreams that seem to be connect to others around them in a shared dream, or dreams that can reveal events or stories. They also soon find the well in the center of town that contains undrinkable black sludge within instead of water.</p>
        <p>A dream that is dreamed by every marked in Raehn eventually reveals the location of a portal next to the priestess palace, and with the help of a marked from Malveria named Khizumie, they manage to get the portal into working order.</p>

        </div>
        <h4 class="poiret">Vieru</h4>
        <p>After using the portal, it takes the marked to a portal that is its twin, except that this portal is located in the cursed swamp of Vieru.</p>
        <p>Vieru is horribly dangerous, filled with magically mutated beasts and plants. Not only that, but those born in Vieru are cursed to be unable to ever leave without horribly dying.</p>
        <p>The newly teleported marked are nearly killed by one of the creatures of Vieru, but are saved by an elven researcher named Phileas who is looking into the high amount of Sygaldry in the area, and an elven Vieru guide known as Trinn.</p>
        <p>The pair lead them back to Trinn's Village of Urioh. There they learn about The Sacred One, a vaunted figure in Vieru since the Sacred One is able to leave the swamp without dying, and represents hope for many of the Vieran people.</p>
        <p>The village chieftain of Urioh reluctantly agrees to allow the strangers to stay, but in return for the hospitality, he insists they must work. In fact, there is much work to be done, as a great festival in Vieru is happening soon. It's known as the Elanei, and it's a festival celebrating the Vieran goddess, Nhysannia, as well as praying for her protection against the dangers of the swamp.</p>
        <p>The cursed do much to help the villagers, and eventually win their trust. Tragedy is to strike when the actual day of the Elanei arrives, however.</p>
        <p>Trinn was not originally from Urioh, but was instead also granted sanctuary by them. Her true parents were swamp worshippers, cultists in the swamp who worship the very swamp itself. They seem to have an odd connection with the monsters there, and despise the Sacred One as they see him as a betrayal to the magic of the swamp.</p>
        <p>Swamp Worshippers arrived on the night before the Elanei, leaving a trail of dead animals towards the village to guide monsters to attack the village. During the manufactured chaos, the Swamp Worshippers kidnapped the Sacred One, and they plan to bring him towards a statue of an elven woman in the center of the swamp.</p>
        <p>This statue in the center of the swamp is permeated with powerful magic. Getting to close will either kill you, or turn you into one of the terrible monsters of the swamp.</p>
        <p>The villagers mistrust Trinn now due to her swamp worshipper connections, and refuse to listen to her when she says she knows which direction the swamp worshippers took the Sacred One. They instead send their own team of trackers who go the wrong way. In desperation, Trinn asks for help from the marked to locate and rescue The Sacred One.</p>
        <p>When they finally reach the Sacred One, they're too late. The Swamp Worshippers had already turned him into a horrible monster. Uncertain of what to do, the marked kill the swamp worshippers and the Sacred One, and return to Urioh with the terrible news.</p>
        <p>The villagers of Urioh are inconsolable as their only hope was killed. They chase all the strangers out of their village, including Phileas. The marked use the portal to return to Raehn, and Phileas agrees to stay there as well as there also seems to be a high amount of Sygaldry in Raehn, in fact, Sygaldry is the very runes that can be found in many places around Raehn, and allows strange magical devices like the portal to work.</p>
        <p>Interested in the portal, he agrees to help Khizumie alter the portal to allow it to teleport its users to anywhere in Tiranthe.</p>

        <h4 class="poiret">The End of the Tyrant's Reign</h4>
        <p>After a huge amount of prisoners suddenly disappeared from Raehn under their watch, the guards grow nervous. They forbid any prisoners from going near the priestess palace, and the atmosphere grows even more oppressive. Elizabht from Malveria is sent to give them assistance, making the total number of guards 6.</p>
        <p>A strange young man from Myrenn named Ferrum and his masked assistant manages to sneak into Raehn, promising hope and redemption from the mark on their skin. He holds a secret meeting in the town hall.</p>
        <p>Ferrum says that the priestess is alive, and that someone else, not the marked, is the true murderer. He believes that the priestess is hiding in the locked priestess palace in Raehn, and wants help from the marked to break into it, with some distracting the guards, and with others helping him investigate the palace.</p>
        <p>When it's time to enact the plan, however, there's a hitch. Elizabht has been found dead, with no wounds on his body. Instead, water leaks from his mouth as if his own body had drowned him. </p>
        <p>This terrifies the guards, as they believe it's a sign of revolt. What was meant to be a mere distraction, turns into a full on battle.</p>
        <p>The battle ends with the guards defeated and captured. Rather than accept this loss of pride, Edgar stabs himself in the throat with his own horn, killing himself.</p>
        <p>Iwao, one of the prisoners of Raehn, kidnaps Cygnus and takes him to face the rage of the prisoners. Cygnus had been a particularly cruel guard, injuring many, and even placing Rowan in the gallows, and tearing the scales off his face to make earrings.</p>
        <p>Cygnus entirely shuts down, unable to handle the situation, and Feiris eventually kills him unbeknownst to any that weren't there.</p>
        <p>The remaining guards are locked in the cathedral. Eventually they are deemed safe enough to release, and Shikra and Kael leave Raehn, while Vale agrees to remain in Raehn to join the prisoners.</p>
        <p>The group that was sent to investigate the palace successfully make it inside, and they find odd elemental rooms, and a large central room made filled with water, with a central stone path shaped like the curse mark.</p>
        <p>The priestess is nowhere to be found within. In private, Ferrum reveals that the priestess had been his mother, and he's distraught at not being able to find her.</p>

      <h4 class="poiret">The Feast of Champions</h4>
      <p>With the death of the guards, there is a new freedom in Raehn. Together, Kobe and Albert plan a great celebration. During the celebration, Satchel takes to the stage and tells the story of a secret 16th god.</p>
      <p>This secret god was actually the first that came into being from the great sea of magic. It was them that created the sapient mortal races. The gods both feared and loved this creation, and it lead to a great war where eventually the secret god, known as The First, was defeated and sealed away.</p>
      <p>Weary of the bloodshed, the gods allowed the creations of The First to remain.</p>

    </div>
    <h4 class="poiret">Myrenn</h4>
    <p>Now that the prisoners are free, yet still considered dangerous by Tiranthe, Satchel gathers everyone together to offer them choices on their next move. He suggests they remain in Raehn, rebuild the barrier, and bring new life to a great city of magic, or they leave Raehn to find a new sanctuary. safe from the world that stands against them.</p>
    <p>After all the votes are cast, the marked vote to remain in Raehn, making rebuilding the portal and the barrier a priority. Ferrum will also help keep up the illusion that Raehn is still a prison, making the guards pass off any new prisoners to guards that are under his employ.</p>
    ,<p>Satchel then mentions Raehn's sister city, one that rests on the cliffs above Raehn, and where the priestess would reside in a palace that looked the same as the one in Raehn before she was murdered.</p>
    <p>This city is Myrenn, and it is in a state of great change. The old king has died, and his daughter, Seren, has recently ascended the throne. This new queen's childhood friend, the seeress of Raehn, has long been under a sleeping curse. Satchel believes that the cursed will be able to enter her dreams and save her, making the queen of Myrenn indebted to them.</p>
    <p>Before the marked travel to Raehn, they have a strange dream-- one where it's revealed that the King himself put the seeress of Raehn, Camellia, with the help of a mysterious advisor.</p>
    <p>The reason he did this was because Camellia had seen a vision that a True King would come and ascend the throne that had been stolen from Myrenn during the Andaran wars. He considered simply killing Camellia, but when one seer in Myrenn dies, another is born soon after. The sleeping curse would prevent another oracle from being born and repeating the dangerous prophecy.</p>
    <p>After this, the quest to Myrenn began. It started with the Cursed meeting in the main chamber of the priestess palace where they played a song to reveal the entryway to the path to Myrenn.</p>
    <p>After that, they were led by Satchel through twisting tunnels to the way up to Myrenn. Using their magic, the Cursed successfully climbed up, and opened a door only to step instantly into the throne room. This causes fear and surprise among the nobles there, but the Cursed manage to convince the queen that they would be able to cure the sleeping curse of the Oracle Camellia. Guard Stonehawk, and Guard Richter have their doubts, but Seren insists that they let the Cursed try. 
      </p>
    <p>They are lead to a room by the guards where they find the sleeping oracle, and decide that half of their number shall enter her dreams, while the other half will watch over the sleeping bodies of their comrades.</p>
    <p>Satchel gives the dreamers sleeping potions, and they enter a strange dream where they don't remember their mission, but instead think they are childhood friends on a beach trip. Camellia is among them, acting as another childhood friend.</p>
    <p>One by one, they start to remember their true purpose for being there and manage to bring clarity to one another. </p>
    <p>Though Camellia is resistant, she eventually remembers that her true childhood friend was Seren, and the gentle dream turns into a nightmare where Seren's corpse rises from the dead and blames her for her death. In a moment of clarity, she also speaks from the dream, warning someone that Seren has been kidnapped, and that the guard Richter cannot be trusted.
      The dream morphs again into a courtroom, where a judge blames Camellia for killing Seren, and brings up the trauma of the cursed. </p>
      <p>The cursed stand up for themselves and Camellia, breaking her out of her chance, and allowing them to awaken.
        Those that remained awake guard their friends dutifully, and talk with Satchel, the queen, and the two guards. </p>
        <p>Richter informs the queen, however, that she is needed elsewhere, and she leaves to attend to her duties.</p>
        <p>When the guards leave, Ferrum makes an appearance, and reveals he has the power to let the others see into dreams, and he reveals what their sleeping friends are going through. They hear Camellia's message about Seren being kidnapped, and immediately go to save Seren before the worst happens. Satchel remains behind to guard those that are sleeping.</p>
        <p>They disguise themselves as maids and butlers, and manage to break into the temple where they see that Richter has Seren tied to a pyre, and they hear him saying something about "serving the true king". Stonehawk lies on the ground, bleeding out.</p>
        <p>Before he burns her, the cursed skillfully take out many of the guards, heal Stonehawk, and whisk the queen to safety. </p>
        <p>They fight off Richter and the remaining guards, capturing them successfully, and while doing so, Candor successfully conducts diplomacy with the queen and she agrees to aid Raehn's cause.</p>
        <p>The dreamers as soon as they awaken along with Camellia go to meet up with the fighters, and the queen and Camellia have a touching reunion.</p>
        <p>Richter is taken to the Myrenn dungeons by Stonehawk, and the day is won! 
        </p>
        <p>Later, the cursed have a dream where they are in the body of the one who hangs Richter. Those marked are the only ones aware that this was a murder. The official cause of death is suicide.</p>

      <p>One of the magically locked mausoleums in the cemetery opens, revealing that there is an extensive underground network of caves beneath Raehn. Magic stones with recordings from the past can be found here, as well as many crystal birds.</p>

    <h4 class="poiret">Triem Sha</h4>
    <p>Another dream is shared by the marked. In this dream a monstrous turtle is dying, cursed to have its heart drain of life by the gods, but before it completely passes away, a water elemental agrees to become its new heart.</p>
    <p>The marked are eager to continue building their reputation in the different regions of Tiranthe, and Satchel suggests Dreto. Phileas and Khizumie say the portal is ready to teleport people, and gives everybody a necklace that's connected to the portal. The portal will teleport to where Phileas and Khizumie program it to go, and once the magic in the connected necklace runs out, they will be teleported back to Raehn.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately the portal wasn't as ready as Phileas and Khizumie believed, and it teleports them into the middle of the desert.</p>
    <p>Fortunately they're found a merchant caravan consisting of Arrash the head of the caravan, Ahmuhia the cook, Bejun her little brother, and Narseh an old traveler. The group agrees to take the group to the Azure Oasis where many merchants are stopping before the head out of Triem Sha to trade their goods.</p>
    <p>At the Azure Oasis, the cursed help the merchants there.</p>
    <p>The cursed woke up one morning to find that the oasis had turned a deep red, and a large turtle similar to the one in their dream was floating in the center of it with a hole in her chest.</p>
    <p>Not only that, but Ahmuhia and Arrash said Bejun and Narseh were missing, and they needed help finding them.</p>
    <p>One group kept an eye on the turtle, and found out she was actually still alive, but the elemental heart that had been keeping her alive was no longer there. They couldn't understand her language, but a strange satchel-like old man that had been unwell near the oasis earlier revealed that he was cursed, and suggested that they enter the turtle's dream to understand her. They did so, and after strange happenings, managed to find the turtle and her dying heart. Through inventiveness, they managed to restore it, making it so that both the turtle and the oasis survived.</p>
    <p>The other group helped Arrash and Ahmuhia find Bejun. They tracked Bejun, Narseh, and another person to the ancient tomb. There they found Narseh holding Bejun hostage, and a strange elemental. Narseh revealed that the cursed are the chosen of the Unknown God or the God of dreams, and that he wishes to restore the unknown god as well. He just needed some magic from the elemental who he freed from the oasis, and he needed the elemental to take a vessel, ideally Bejun. The elemental was suspicious of him, and didn't wish to take Bejun's body, so instead he tried to take the body of one of the cursed. He managed to possess B's body, but was forced out by B, and Nameless. Meanwhile, Rowan and Yuda managed to incapacitate Narseh and save Bejun, telling him, Ahmuhia, and Arrash to escape. The elemental tried to escape, but was chased, and was convinced to go back to Raehn. Narseh, however, mysteriously burned from the inside when he was about to say something.
      The oasis, and Bejun were saved, and as if the skies were celebrating as well, it began to rain on the desert sands.</p>

    <h4 class="poiret">Myrenn Botanical Gardens Pt. 1</h4>
    <p>Myrenn’s botanical garden is vaunted for both the lovely glass domed building that encases it, as well as the huge variety of plants under its care. Healers, alchemists, and travelers alike use its services extensively, and this month is of particular excitement as the Adora Passiflora is going to bloom in a couple of weeks– an event that only happens once every 8 years. </p>
    <p>Witnessing this rare event, and drinking a rare drink made from the nectar of the flowers, is said to bring good luck in love, but the excitement of this miracle of nature has been dampened by the disappearance of two gardeners. This happens from time to time– especially with the presence of some… particularly dangerous plants, but this time each disappearance has coincided with a curse mark painted somewhere in the vicinity. </p>
    <p>Due to the circumstances, Stonehawk, the royal guard of Myrenn, has asked if any citizens of Raehn would be willing to volunteer as temporary gardeners, and investigate the disappearances. Hopefully this isn’t a sign of a larger trend.</p>
    <p>Many of the citizens of Raehn went to investigate the mystery of the missing gardeners, going to different sections of Myrenn's treasured gardens to interview the people there.
    </p>
    <p><strong>main section:</strong> Here the cursed met Head Botanist Charlumin, the one in charge of the gardens, and Lady Rogeesin, a noble lady that donated considerable funds to the gardens and was helping oversee the festivities. Here they learned that the gardens were heavily defended due to many thefts of the precious plants. They also learned that most of the gardeners weren't overly worried about the disappearances. Workers had run off before. </p>
    <p>Both of the gardeners that had gone missing were new hires that had applied to work at the garden around the same time. They both desired to work in the medicinal section. They were quick learners, but were also people that didn't stand out very much. They seemed to have no friends except for each other, though they were nice enough.</p>
    <p>They also discussed the distrust that the nobles had for the cursed, and the unpopularity of the Queen of Myrenn's recent decision to stop hunting and incriminating those with the curse mark.</p>
    <p><strong>medicinal section:</strong> Here the cursed met Olnesia, Charlumin's assistant, and the two head gardeners in charge of assigning the two missing gardeners work. </p>
    <p>Here they learned that the mark was painted in obvious areas, as if someone had wanted them to see it. They also learned that both gardeners had been working at night when security is more lax the night they disappeared, and that though the guards had seen them enter, they never saw the two missing gardeners leave. They also learned that the Adora Passiflora had magic storing capabilities, though it wasn't as effective as the magic storing capabilities that minerals have.</p>
    <p><strong>poisonous section:</strong> Here the cursed meet Ivokas, a nervous gardener. Ivokas eventually informed them that they noticed one of the poisonous plants had gone missing: a plant called Aleuritetara. It could be made into a poisonous mist, though when used it turns your skin a shade of purple. 
    </p>
    <p>The plant was then properly checked out a few days later by Olnesia, but Ivokas was certain it went missing before then. Ivokas insists that Olnesia is a good person, however.</p>
    <p><strong>carnivorous section: </strong>Here the cursed meet Belkath, a strange gardener that likes plants more than people. He shows them how they've trained the plants to only eat food that has a certain scent to it-- a scent that was developed by Charlumin, and is carefully guarded. </p>
    <p>Though one of the large carnivorous plants hasn't been eating well like it should, Belkath doubts that it ate the gardeners because none of the scent he used to spray on the food had gone missing-- and Belkath would know. He carefully keeps track of the inventory.</p>
    <p>misc section: Some of the cursed went to go discuss the crime with Stonehawk, the head of Myrenn's guard. Stonehawk told them that she had a bad feeling about this crime. It was strange-- when Stonehawk went to interview the families of the two missing gardeners, the families seemed to want to have nothing to do with the guards, or seem all that interested in finding their missing kin. Not only that but the rooms of the gardeners seemed almost completely devoid of personality. They also learned about the politics of the holy senate of myrenn, and how Rogeesin's family supports a member of the holy senate called Lord Navus. Lord Navus isn't a supporter of the 'True King', but instead wishes for another priestess to be chosen by the gods so that the priestess can take her place as the rightful ruler of Myrenn.</p>
    <p>When the cursed went to interview the families themselves, Stonehawk's story about the families being uncaring was confirmed. One family was a gardener that worked for a Lady that also supported Lord Navus's faction, and the other family was a drunk pilgrim that was originally from Lealia. They seemed to care nothing for their missing children at all.</p>
    <p><strong>The time of the festival:</strong>
      It was finally time for the flowers to bloom, and the nobles and the cursed watch and wait. The magical flowers bloom without a hitch, but when it comes time for the honorary drink Lady Rogeesin suddenly collapses. 
      </p>
      <p>All the nobles at the festival start to panic, and to blame the cursed, but fortunately the citizens of Raehn manage to save Lady Rogeesin just before she dies, and healers start to help her just in time. </p>
      <p>The drinks she drank didn't appear to be poisoned despite her reaction, and none of the other nobles were harmed. 
      </p>
      <p>The cursed take the information they know, and start to try and unveil the plot.
      </p>
      <p>They decide Lady Rogeesin had been faking her poisoning, and this was instead a plot to incriminate the cursed, and increase dissatisfaction with the queen. She orchestrated the disappearances of two people, then waited for an influential event full of nobles like this festival before pretending to be nearly killed by the cursed. </p>
      <p>Rogeesin protests at first, but then admits to having committed not the crime of murder, but of lying about being poisoned. She's escorted away, and the day is saved.</p>
      <p>Olnesia disappears soon after though, leaving behind only a note of apology.</p>
      <p><strong>Afterwards:</strong>
        Lady Rogeesin was eventually tried, and though a relation between her and the gardeners that had disappeared could not be found, she was fined and sent to do public service to pay for her lies. She was also banned from participating in any work involving the holy senate.</p>
        <p>The drunk pilgrim that was one of the gardener's parents was soon found dead, having overindulged in his habit. The family of the other gardener left Myrenn behind suddenly, never to return. Is this truly over?</p>

      <h4 class="poiret">The Myrenn Botanical Gardens Pt. 2</h4>
      <p>Olnesia from the botanical garden had been missing for months, but she suddenly turned up as a surprise guest in Raehn. She confessed that she'd been the one to make the two gardeners disappear, painted the curse mark, and tried to kill Rogeesin. </p>
      <p>However, she insisted that this was all for a good reason, and that someone in her dreams insisted that she could get help in Raehn.</p>
      <p>Rogeesin was, in truth, in charge of a hidden magical laboratory that conducted unwilling human experimentation. In Myrenn, however, she was seen as a philanthropist-- a kind hearted woman who funded all sorts of good causes.</p>
      <p>One of those causes was an orphanage she funded, though in truth it was run by people that worked for her, and at times, orphans would be taken from the orphanage and brought to the laboratory to be experimented on. Olnesia had been one of those orphans, though she'd made her escape years ago, and hoped to put the memories behind her forever.
      </p>
      <p>The gardeners whom she'd recognized, and Rogeesin wouldn't let her forget, however, and not only that, she began to have strange dreams where Senja from Raehn planned with her, and asked for her help to shut down the operation for good.
      </p>
      <p>With the help of Raehn, one team went into the lab to distract the scientists, attracting the attention of the guards, and releasing a number of magical creatures into the premises. They found a strange scientist named Silvio who insisted the lab originally started as something with a noble cause, and found some of the children in some cells as well.</p>
      <p>Another team went through a different interest to rescue the orphans from their room. There they found Senja who had been brutally experimented on, discovered some strange artifacts, found some notes about strange dreams, and rescued the rest of the children.
        The two teams met up in the central area of the lab. There they met Rogeesin, who was trying to feed the last missing elemental child a bottle with a strange liquid. Ransom tried to bargain with her for a peaceful end. The other team began dismantling crystals that the children insisted Rogeesin would draw her power from. During the bargaining, they convinced the elemental child to move to safety.</p>
        <p>The bargaining almost succeeded, but Tabitha stopped it, and with illusory magic, made it appear that Rogeesin was holding the wrong bottle, and the true bottle was in her possession, though in truth what she had was a sleeping draught. With some trickery, Rogeesin ended up drinking the sleeping draught, and was captured.</p>
        <p>Stonehawk met them at the entrance of the lab, deciding to imprision Rogeesin, and take the children into Myrenn's care.
        </p>
        <p>Raehn disagreed initially, and discussed with Stonehawk what would happen next. They agreed to some terms that involved the safety of the children, the imprisonment of Rogeesin by Myrenn, Raehn ambassadors, and finally, agreed that Myrenn would take the credit for the discovery of the lab to strengthen Queen's Seren's political power.</p>
        <p><strong>Aftermath:</strong>The children were taken to live in a section of the palace, and given a caretaker, and magic tutor. Senja has returned, once again, to Raehn.</p>
        <p>Lord Navus's faction was weakened by the horrific revelations. Queen Seren's waning popularity was invigorated, and the lab's documents were destroyed so that the experiments couldn't be replicated. The artifacts were stowed away somewhere safely, inaccessible to the general populace. Raehn's involvement remains unknown except to a few individuals, but those individuals are grateful.</p>
        <p>Olnesia was welcomed back to work in the botanical garden with open arms, and will always be grateful that the nightmare she had experienced will never happen again.</p>

      <h4 class="poiret">Mushrooms and Malveria</h4>
      <p>The marked have another dream...</p>
      <p>A mysterious creator grows bored with their creation, a monster named Yxsyth.</p>
      <p>Feeling abandoned, Yxsyth grows stronger and stronger in hopes that he'll be loved again, and that he'd be able to climb to the stars where the gods reside.</p>
      <p>Before he could make the attempt to climb to the stars, Sindariel kills him. Ysyxth grows to hate the gods, and instead allows himself to be absorbed by Tiranthe.</p>
      <p>After this dream, those that delve into the caves start to get infected with a strange disease, with the very first infected being Eli.</p>
      <p>Mushrooms are growing in the caves, and their spores cause strange symptoms: an unwillingness to leave Raehn, and vivid hallucinations that can be seen by multiple people.</p>
      <p>Owein sees a terrible vision:</p>
      <p><em>It’s as if a snowstorm had descended upon Raehn, except for the snow is a pale blue color. The snow below isn’t cold, but instead is soft and powdery. It puffs up with every step. </em></p>
      <p><em>Owein recognizes familiar faces– Rowan, Freyr, and Shion. They stare up at the blue powder cascading down with a hollow-eyed gaze.
      </em></p>
      <p><em>Something disturbs their reverie, however, and like a colony of rabbits expecting a predator, they all turn at the same time, facing somewhere past Owein.
      </em></p>
      <p><em>When Owein turns to look, he sees Eli, a look of desperation on his face. “Malveria had a cure!” he says. “We can fix this. We can still fix this.” He rushes to Owein, a bottle of a pale liquid in his hands. “Please drink this,” he says. 
      </em></p>
      <p><em>Owein doesn’t answer, though he wants to.</em></p>
      <p><em>“Owein?” Eli says.</em></p>
      <p><em>The bottle is a threat. Every cell of his body screams that, though a small voice in his mind tells him it’s his only salvation.</em></p>
      <p><em>He ignores the voice, and takes the bottle. Eli looks hopeful, but that hope quickly dies as he lets the bottle fall to the ground and shatter.</em></p>
      <p><em>He steps on the crushed glass for good measure. Eli cries out, moving to crouch down in a futile effort to save the contents, but Owein pulls him into a hug instead.</em></p>
      <p><em>“There’s nothing to fix,” he says. Are those his words? They’re coming from his lips, but it feels like they belong to someone else. “Just stay here. With me. You’ll come to see the truth as well.”</em></p>
      <p>This vision is relayed to others in Raehn, and a plan is made to quarantine infected wihtin Raehn, destroy the mushroom in the caves, and send non infected to a save camp outside of Raehn, and then to Malveria to find this supposed cure.</p>
      <p>Steadily the symptoms are getting worse: Nausea, feverishness, occasional difficulty breathing, fatigue, and eyes flashing blue are all present as the marked's minds battle the mind of the fungi.</p>
      <p><strong>Mushrooms:</strong>After the meeting, Elysia, a golem who is resistant to the disease, decides to venture into the caves to help save Raehn. Though she's resistant to the spores, infected deer attack her, and she gets absorbed by the mushrooms.</p>
      <p>Eventually, more people start to go missing into the caves, and a team is sent to rescue them as well as destroy the mushrooms with acid.</p>
      <p>The mushroom tries to fool them with hallucinations, and the animals in the caves are difficult to kill as the mushroom will repair their broken bodies with fungus, and force them to fight longer. They even have to fight Elysia who is puppeted by the mushroom, but they defeat her, and manage to bring her back onto their side.</p>
      <p>Eventually the mushroom team manages to find the large mushroom controlling the rest. They destroy it with acid, only to discover that Eli is inside, his eyes now a striking blue.</p>
      <p>Once this is done, their minds are recovered, but for some reason they are still unable to leave the borders of Raehn...</p>
      <p><strong>Malveria:</strong> Once the head mushroom is defeated, the non infected use the portal to teleport to Malveria. Unfortunately the coordinates are slightly off once again, and instead of being in the technological city of wonders, they are teleported onto the dangerous snowy peaks of the Mara Mountains.</p>
      <p>It's cold and unforgiving, but a nearby snow cave promises shelter. The group heads there, but before all of them can enter, the entrance to the cave collapses, splitting the group in half. When the magic users try to clear the way, the very mountain resists them, and instead gives the casters a sharp pain. It's as if the mountain itself bears a great anger within it.</p>
      <p>The group outside hears a scream, and they decide to follow it in hopes of finding people that know what's going on.</p>
      <p>There they find two Malverian elf researches, Sharanta, and Jirynpel Sal. The two are fighting two elves that appear to be made entirely of crystal. The group helps them fight it off, and Sharanta and Jirynpel take them back to their camp.</p>
      <p>Jirynpel Sal is recognized by Phileas who reveals that he had released a controversial book on magical theory that said that magic and memories were closely intertwined. He posited that when people died, their magic released back into Tiranthe, and it kept a piece of their memories as well.</p>
      <p>Jirynpel believed that these memories could be retrieved if the magic could be sealed in crystal, but his research was considered lunacy by many, but was funded by a few of the wealthy. Every experiment ended up being a failure.</p>
      <p>Jirynpel and Sharanta, his assistant, agree to help find the friends they were separated from and to take them to Malveria, as all of their previous bodyguards have been killed.</p>
      <p>Sharanta reveals that she was once a former coworker of Khizumie, and that Jirynpel has abandoned his previous research. He is now working on finding a cure to zenosphinication, a strange disease that affects only Malverians. Those infected fall into a deep sleep, and their skin steadily grows translucent, and their body hardens until they fully crystalize. Once they are fully crystalized, the body disappears entirely. Jirynpel, though he's been unable to find a cure, has had success with a potion that is able to slow the progression of the disease.</p>
      <p>They find a cave that they believed their companions were lost in, and Sigmund tries to use magic on the crystal inside. When he tries, he hears thousands of voices in his head.</p>
      <p>When they enter the cave, they find not their companions, but instead a crystalline obelisk with words in an ancient language on its surface. Not only that but a crystalline body melds out ofthe tunnel walls. The body belongs to Vraeldrynn, an ancient prince who took the Malverian people to this mountain, and built their home there. In fact, what they had stumbled on was his resting place.</p>
      <p>Vraeldrynn reveals that Malverian elves are outside of the usual cycle of magic upon death, and grants the group four questions that he will answer.</p>
      <p>The first boon is an answer to the cure of the fungi infection. Vraeldrynn says that the cause of that and Zenosphinication are caused by something similar, but the crystal disease is much much stronger. The medicine Jirynpel made should be able to fully cure the mushroom disease, however.</p>
      <p>The next question is what is Vraeldrynn's purpose for being here. Vraeldrynn answers that even he isn't certain and thinks it's either that he's well liked by the mountain, or it's a cruel game to force him to watch what happens to his empire and his people without him being able to have a hand in it.</p>
      <p>The third question is what is the true purpose behind the mark?</p>
      <p>Vraeldrynn answers: "...It's the mark that means you're favored, or that you've been touched, by the unnamed cursed one that watches all, but exists now only in dreams. The one this mountain wants to meet above all else. 

        You've been gifted a fragment of their power, but even the tiniest fragment is a power to fear. The world is right to be terrified of you."</p>
        <p>The last question is how do they rescue their missing companions? Vraeldrynn gives them a key, then borrows the power of the curse mark to show them his history.</p>
        <p>He speaks of how the Malveri were at a disadvantage in the wars against the VAlensir, Xyraphim, and Tyltara. He was the prince of the Malveri, and his father was useless. He felt he had to do something to save his people.</p>
        <p>He believed if he climbed the tallest mountain in the world, he would catch the attention of the gods. At the peak he did find a god, but instead of the god of justice or god of valor, it was the god of chaos, Fakian.</p>
        <p>Fakian appeared to be playing a strange game with a large crystal, and when Vraeldrynn begged for his aid, he decided to facilitate a threeway deal between him, the prince, and the crystal. The crystal would give Vraeldrynn the powerful crystals on the mountain that had a greater capacity for storing magic tahn any other. Fakian would give Vraeldrynn the knowledge of how to make terrifying weapons out of this crystal. In return, Vraeldrynn would give his peoples memories to the mountain when they died, and would allow Fakian to change his people to look more like the god of chaos himself. What the crystal gave Fakian, and what Fakian gave the crystal, is as of yet unknown. </p>
        <p>The weapons saved his people, but even the prince feared their power, and thought they had the power to destroy the world. He brought his people to the mountain, and forbade his people from ever sharing their knowledge with outsiders.</p>
        <p>But eventually he learned the true cost of what giving the mountain their memories upon death meant. Malverians would not face Sindariel's mercy and be brought to the stars, instead, when Malverians die they are forced to become part of the mountain.</p>
        <p>with his story told, Vraeldrynn expresses his wish that the people there try and end it.</p>
        <p>Phileas reveals he's a summoner, and allows the group into his chaos realm. Using his chaos realm, they are able to use the key Vraeldrynn granted them to open a door to where their lost companions are...</p>
        <p>Going back in time, the other half of the group had been trapped in the caves. They meet Rhea there, who had ended up in a similar predicament.</p>
        <p>They try to find a way out, but crystalline hands reach from the walls and floors of the cave, grabbing the group to drag them into the mountain. When they come to, they find themselves in a strange place that looks like a bleak gallery. Doors in this place lead to strange places, and much of the art seems to be statues of elves, some of them broken.</p>
        <p>A strange creature with a head that looks only like a deep abyss is smashing some of the statues into pieces. It's known as The Collector, and after listening to some of the groups demands agrees to help them-- for a price.</p>
        <p>It holds Nameless in front of a blank canvas, and asks to be shown home. Nameless's memories paint themselves onto the canvas, and are taken from Nameless forever.</p>
        <p>Once this is done, the collector gives its rib bone to Nameless, saying that it can eat what does not belong to the flesh it inhabits.</p>
        <p>A door then opens, opened by their friends using the key from Vraeldrynn, and they are rescued from the strange space.</p>
        <p>Within the tomb, Sharanta is able to use technology found there to craft a portal, and the entire group teleports to Malveria. The are brought to a special low technology area for non Malverians, and are treated there until they return home.</p>
        <p>Jirynpel gives them the cure, and gives Sigmund a resonator that they can use to communicate and stay updated on the mushroom disease, and the condemnation of Malverian souls to purgatory.</p>
        <p><strong>Return to Raehn:</strong>The cure is distributed to everyone, and eventually even Eli. Eli resists the cure, but Owein forces him to drink it. Even after the cure, one of Eli's eyes remains a vibrant blue. Later that night, when both Owein and Eli are asleep, Eli awakens.</p>
        <p>In a trance, he makes his way to the well in the center of Raehn. He coughs up something that resembles a tiny blue mushroom into the well. It plops into the water, and Eli's reflection thanks him. He slumps by the well and rests there until Owein finds him, with no memories of what had happened.</p>

    <h4 class="poiret">A Fateful Meeting</h4>
    <p>While in Myrenn, Rue meets a young elf named Ilyara, who says she's from a group of treasure hunters. She gives Rue three magical necklaces, and they meet 4 days later.</p>

  <h4 class="poiret">The Myrenn Dance of Mirrors</h4>
  <p>In Myrenn the date of the Dance of Mirrors is approaching. This dance celebrates the day that the famed seeress Sidaria of history gave some of her power to the first seer of Myrenn. 
  </p>
  <p>Camellia, one of the seers had a vision about danger coming to Queen Seren unless the marked were there to stop it, so the marked were invited to attend among the nobles, introduced as heroes of Myrenn.
  </p>
  <p>At the dance they met 5 members of the holy council: Camellia herself, Lord Navus, Lady Imlasca, Lord Leror, and Pontifex Ueyi who was the current head of the church. </p>
  <p>One member of the Holy council was missing however-- Lord Palos, an old member of the council who was almost like a father figure to Queen Seren.
  </p>
  <p>Near the end of the ball, Lord Navus decided to introduce his adopted daughter to everyone attending, and to everyone's surprise, including the Queen's, he revealed that his new adopted daughter, Violetta, was chosen by the divine powers to be a new priestess-- to prove it, the magic artifact that had identified priestesses for years marked his words as true.</p>
  <p>Interrupting the affair, however, was the missing council member who stumbled into the ballroom with a bleeding wound, touched his throat while looking at Queen Seren, then died.</p>
  <p>The ball was halted, and everybody was prevented from leaving until the murderer was caught. Stonehawk allowed the marked to help with the investigation. </p>
  <p>They discovered that Palos was on track to discovering that this new priestess's divinity was somehow faked, but was killed before he could reveal the truth. He had a hint in his locket that was missing, and it became imperative to find who had stolen it. </p>
  <p>The investigation eventually focused on Lord Leror-- Palos had left a message on a wine label: an L and a crown on it marked in blood. 
  </p>
  <p>The marked agreed to accuse Leror, and Verne decided to reveal the timeline, accusing Navus of being involved with the crime as well, as it was Navus who would have a motive to conceal the new Priestess. It was also publically revealed that the new priestess was false.</p>
  <p>Leror was revealed to have the stolen locket on his person, though direct evidence couldn't be found to pin down Navus.
  </p>
  <p>When the locket was returned to Seren's possession, she opened it to find it had a single name written on it: 'Olnesia', the name of the woman who had originally revealed the magical laboratory to the marked.</p>
  <p>Unwilling to reveal Olnesia's name to the public and potentially put her in danger, the writing that was revealed to the public instead was 'Investigate the Holy Senate', written surreptitiously by Ayame.</p>
  <p>With this, Seren is able to put the members of the Holy Senate, including Navus and his daughter, on house arrest until the investigation could be continued, while Leror who had committed the murder, is jailed.</p>
  <p>After the chaos, Stonehawk and Camellia meet with the marked in private. Since Verne had so publicly accused Navus without enough evidence to pin him down, they decide to pretend to scrap him by preserving his core stone and getting rid of the rest of his body to satisfy Navus's anger and prevent further retribution.</p>
  <p>Camellia reveals that she had another vision to the marked-- one pertaining to the rumors that were starting to spread about the cursed being the ones to summon a terrible monster. She saw that a cult, The Servants of the God of Dreams, was after powerful bits of elemental energy they called hearts, and that they needed it to summon this beast that's spoken of. They can be stopped if hearts are retrieved before they're able to get them however, and to make things easier the Cursed already possess the heart of water, and Camellia knows the location of the Heart of Light-- it will be in Dreto during Dreto's Playwright's festival.</p>
  <p><strong>Afterwards:</strong>Seren and Camellia interviewed Olnesia, and confirmed that Violetta, the priestess, was one of the experiments in the magical laboratory. It was here that Violetta was able to achieve divinity so close to that of  Priestess that it was able to fool Myrenn's sacred artifact. </p>
  <p>Leror eventually revealed details of his crime. He said he was contacted by a servant in the palace he didn't recognize who informed him they were a messenger of the True King, and that Palos had to be stopped before the ball as the identity of the True King was in his locket and Palos planned to reveal it.</p>
  <p>Eager to help the King, and also curious about the identity, Leror decided to take it upon himself to stop Palos moments before the ball.</p>
  <p>He sent a message to Palos that he knew some important information that couldn't wait, and Palos agreed to meet him in his office. They were served tea, and Leror tried to poison the tea before Palos drank it.</p>
  <p>Palos somehow noticed the tea was poisoned, and confronted Leror about it. Leror, in a panic, decided to stab Palos with a dagger he stolen from Imlasca, and poisoned earlier. 
  </p>
  <p>Palos soon stopped moving, so Leror wrapped him in cloaks he'd found around Palos's office, and dragged the body into one of the secret passageways so it wouldn't be noticed by servants. He then hastily covered the blood with nearby mess, then left the office to sneak the incriminating dagger into Imlasca's office via hidden passageway. </p>
  <p>He incinerated his bloodied clothes, changed into new clothes suitable for the ball, and was able to attend it. What he wasn't aware of was that Palos hadn't died quite yet, and was able to send a final message to the Queen before he passed on.

<h4 class="poiret">Deception in Dreto</h4>
<p>Following the seer Camellia's advice, the marked decide to go to Dreto when Dreto's playwright's festival arrives. Phileas had previously contacting Inanna, and Inanna had managed to get them a meeting with the richest woman in Dreto-- Contessina. What's even better is that Contessina is rumored to have an artifact in her vault, and it's very likely that this artifact is the Heart of Light Camellia spoke of.</p>
<p>The marked take the portal and are teleported outside the Wyrmbone bridge that leads across the Orozen river in Dreto. There, they see some familiar faces from Triem Sha-- Arrash, Ahmuhia, and Bejun from the merchant's caravan.</p>
<p>After speaking with the group from Triem Sha, they learn that Arrash's younger brother is actually the Prince of Thieves within Dreto. Though Arrash has a stormy relationship with his brother, he eventually relents and agrees to take some of the marked along with him to see his brother since his brother knows Dreto well, and might be able to give them some helpful advice.</p>
<p>Part of the group splits off and follows Arrash, there they meet Khalid, his brother, who welcomes them with open arms. Khalid explains that he knows that they were invited by Contessina since he does appear to have an extensive information network throughout Aplens, and he explains that he also knows that they will be asked to perform a play in Contessina's own home on the final day of the Playwright's festival.</p>
<p>He makes a deal with the cursed, saying that since they wish to keep the heart of light out of the hands of the Servants of the God of Dreams, he'll give them information about the vault in return for helping him rob it, and giving him the artifact within. They learn that he wishes to have the artifact so that he can use its power and riches to build a kingdom in Triem Sha.</p>
<p>He's eventually convinced to not be given the artifact by the group and by Sofia, but he insists that instead they gather a lot of riches for him in return for his information.</p>
<p>The other half of the group goes to meet Contessina with Inanna as planned. They go to her luxurious mansion, and see her there with her son, Gian, by her side. Contessina is extremely eccentric, and her son seems like the more mature one in their relationship. Contessina informs the group that she welcomes them, and that she understands their plight of wanting to be accepted by the world. She asks them to perform a grand play in her home to her and other nobles on the final day of the Playwright's festival. In particular, the play will be a tragedy, and the marked are free to write it themselves.</p>
<p>Once both groups are given their tasks, they're free to spend their time in Aplens planning for these two tasks, and enjoying the festival.</p>
<p>During this time Rue meets once again with Ilyara who is giving fortunes to people in the Fortuna District. Their conversation takes a dark turn when Ilyara reveals she's part of an ancient group of protectors, and this group has reinvoked ancient treaties to unite many regions into killing the marked instead of sending them to the prison in Raehn. This is spurred on by the fact that peculiar monsters are appearing throughout Tiranthe and killing people, and they appear to be connected to the cursed. Ilyara also speaks of a prophecy from the seer Sidaria about how those with the mark will summon a great monster that will end Tiranthe.</p>
<p>When the final day of the playwright's festival finally arrives, both groups are ready with their play, and with the heist. The play, written by Baghead, is a touching story about the Swamp Prince and the Child of Light. Those in the heist make a mistake in the room with the levers, and end up earning the attention of Contessina's son, Gian. Gian is not actually human, but is an illusion manifested by the artifact that's hidden in Contessina's vault. The artifact, in fact, has powers of both influencing one's mind, and powers of illusion. Gian, eager to play with those robbing the vault, makes things harder for them by adding illusions to the traps in the vault.</p>
<p>Gian, fortunately, is connected directly to Contessina, so when she gets overly emotionally affected by the play, he's summoned back to her side to comfort her. The people performing the play manage to distract Gian enough so that those in the vault are able to make it to the final room. Once there, they speak with Gian, and manage to convince him that he's hurting Contessina, so that they'll take his place and keep her safe if he goes with them. He agrees, and is now on the side of the marked.</p>
<p>During the play, a strange woman called Amyri joins Contessina in her box. Contessina dislikes her because she fears that since Amyri is a member of the Ea'Shenar, a group that destroys and seals artifacts, that they will take Gian from her and seal him. Amyri proposes a deal-- she will leave Gian alone until Contessina dies as long as Contessina signs a document-- a document that will allow the Ea'Shenar to use their powers in Dreto to execute the cursed. Contessina refuses until Gian, concerned at how close the vault group is getting to the final room, reveals that the marked are trying to steal him away from her. In her panic, Contessina signed the document giving them what they asked for.</p>
<p>They are about to continue watching the play until Ziel, furious that Gian had used his powers of suggestion to make Ziel break off his horn and stab himself, tries to attack Contessina. Amyri manages to block the attack, but since it was an attack, she sends her Ea'Shenar knights to apprehend those on the stage. Things start to get chaotic, but Baghead, also influenced by Gian, suddenly takes off their Bag and reveals their face. It turns out that Baghead has a similar ability to the Child of Light that makes people see their ideal face on Baghead's face, and gives people a desire to possess Baghead. This manages to distract the Ea'Shenar long enough so that the vault team can retrieve Gian, and use his powers to temporarily blind the Ea'Shenar. When the groups meet up, Gian also brings along Contessina, and they are all teleported back to Raehn by Phileas except for Morgana who opted to stay behind and allow herself to get captured by the group.</p>
<p>When they return to Raehn, they see Camellia waiting. Camellia informs the group that all of them, and Seren, is in danger, and that she needs the heart of light to save them. They eventually hand over the heart of light, and she suddenly throws it into the well. Contessian, distraught, jumps after Gian who had been thrown in the well, and also disappears in the black waters.</p>
<p>Camellia informs the group that this will cause all of Tiranthe to forget about Myrenn and Raehn, except for people already from the respective cities, and people that are marked. She then returns to Myrenn, promising to explain later.</p>
<p>Shion later returns to Aplens that is fearful and covered in Ea'Shenar guards, meeting with Khalid first, and later with Klaus, Contessina's butler. Klaus tells Shion about Contessina's past-- she was originally a beautiful village woman who was coveted by the baron of a section of land in Dreto. Klaus was a guard sent by the baron to kidnap Contessina from her home and deliver her to him. She wed the baron, and bore a son called Gian. She eventually grew paranoid and started killing people, including her husband, and she pressured her son to try and become the perfect lord. When he grew to his 20's he started to hate his mother a joined a rebellion against her and her bloodthirsty ways. She ordered members of the rebellion burned at the stake, and only learned that one of them was her son when it was too late. She lost her mind and will to live, so the rebellion started to storm her castle. Klaus helped her escape, and while she escaped she met the Phantasmia butterfly, the artifact that would eventually become the illusory Gian. The illusory Gian brought Contessina to Aplens, using his powers to grant her power and riches beyond compare. After learning the story Shion took the sapphire wasp queen from Contessina's vault, and gave Klaus a contact to her art gallery so that Klaus could sell Contessina's remaining artwork to them.</p>
