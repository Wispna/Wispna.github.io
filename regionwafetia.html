                    <p><strong>Region Name:</strong> Wafetia</p>
                    <p><strong>Capital City:</strong> Shenedorei</p>
                    <p><strong>Primary God:</strong> Solq</p>
                    <p><strong>Races:</strong> 60% elves, 20% humans, 20% everything else. This region is particularly cold to Feroxi, turning them away from its borders and denying them stay should they attempt to enter.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Wafetia is luscious and green, with trees that put citadels to shame with their size. Both the people and the cities here have a knack for assimilating seamlessly with nature, communities thriving in discreet homes that spiral up tree trunks up into the canopy above. On the east side of the region, trees thin out and are replaced by tall mushroom forests which continue on into the deadly swamp past the region’s border.</p>
                    <p>Wafetia is the last standing Elf-dominated region in the North, due to Andaras’ past conquests. As a result, the region has come to value military power as a means of protecting itself, always wary of the possibility of Andaras attempting to overtake the region in the future. Fortunately, the region is hard to infiltrate by land, as it’s protected by the Mara mountains to the south and a deadly swamp to the east.</p>

                    <p><strong>Region Name:</strong> Wafetia</p>
                    <p><strong>Capital/Notable Cities:</strong></p>
                    <p>Shenedorei- Capital. The reigning royal resides here with their advisors.</p>
                    <p>Caelora - port town, with ships that transport and trade with Kessa and Dreto</p>
                    <p><strong>Government Type:</strong> Monarchy (constitutional). A monarch is elected in Wafetia every thirty years, chosen from all the royal families. The royal families govern their areas but ultimately report to the lead monarch’s orders if needed. Aside from the monarchs, the region generally leans towards meritocracy in electing important government officials.</p>
                    <p><strong>Population:</strong> Medium sized.</p>
                    <p><strong>Population Type:</strong> 60% elves, 20% humans, 20% everything else. No Feroxi.</p>

                    <p><strong>Other Popular Gods</strong> Luwaria, Saiphina, their relationship with Alorel is complicated because they detest Andaras who passionately follows her.</p>
                    <p><strong>Major Landscapes:</strong> Large expansive forests, grasslands. Soil is rich and many things easily grow.</p>
                    <p><strong>Major Resources:</strong>  Plants and greenery, wood, medicinal plants, dyes, paints, beauty products, natural oils, inks/dyes, coal, fruit, wine.</p>
                    <p><strong>General Climate:</strong> Mediterranian climate. Mild temperatures. Gets a lot of rainfall, particularly near the coasts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Influence Over the World:</strong> Mild, elves used to be a leading world power before Andaras conquered much of elven territory.</p>

                    <p><strong>How the rest of Tiranthe views them:</strong> The area is seen as distant and untouchable for most. Most of the stories of the area are spoken by traders who see it-- who call the lands majestic and ethereal. Elves are viewed as a selfish and arrogant group of people by many.</p>
                    <p><strong>Issues this country faces:</strong> Isolation. A stringent focus on tradition impacts social and technological progress. To be accepted by society they must maintain a stringent decorum. </p>
                    <p><strong>What’s the economy like?:</strong> Mostly self-sufficient. </p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What are the main languages spoken?:</strong> Elven, common</p>
                    <p><strong>Where do most people live?:</strong> Settlements are dispersed fairly evenly throughout the continent, although the population is larger in the West than the East, as many are apprehensive of being too close to the death swamp on the east border.</p>
                    <p><strong>How does this country view magic?:</strong> Magic is ingrained in Elven culture, and society invests a lot into the training of mages and understanding of it. An Elf with no understanding of magic is rare to come by, and people with zero magical skill are seldom taken seriously. </p>
                    <p><strong>How technologically advanced is this country? Is magic preferred?:</strong> Magic is usually preferred. The Elven language has some of the oldest written books on the continent, and the language itself is complex and meticulous in its specificity.</p>
                    <p><strong>How is history recorded?:</strong> Family history is passed orally, and traditions are expected to pass down the bloodline. Books are popular as well, particularly for more formal aspects of history.</p>
                    <p><strong>How many are educated, and how?:</strong> Everybody is educated. Parents are expected to play a large part in their child’s early education and the government enables them to do so. As children reach adolescence, they attend institutions or take apprenticeships with village elders, honing their education in a specialized field from a young age.</p>
                    <p><strong>How did the majority of current people come to be on this land?:</strong> Most were born.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why do people choose to live here?:</strong> Rich nature. For elves, many see it as a sanctuary from other races. Good natural defenses provided by the terrain.</p>
                    <p><strong>How popular is the government?:</strong> Neither liked or disliked.</p>
                    <p><strong>How are criminals charged and punished?:</strong> Crime in Wafetia is rare, as tarnished pride is an ailment most Elves fear more than death. Crime that does occur incurs a debt, declared by the regional noble, which must then be repaid before an elf is accepted back into society. The debt is most often a sentence of servitude for the lands in the form of labor, but occasionally takes other forms at the discretion of the noble who decides the punishment.</p>
                    <p>Executions are reserved for only the most despicable traitors and war criminals. Banishment and exile is most common for non-elven criminals.</p>
