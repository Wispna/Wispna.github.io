                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Selpharas is a cold tundra region with a multitude of mountains and sparse grasslands. The capital city of Selpharim is perched atop the largest mountain in the region, The Hollow Heights. Selpharim is run as a Theocracy with the living goddess, Sindariel The Silent, as the head of state. Everything happens with the church at its center. Most people live outside the holy cathedral and subsist primarily in agriculture, raising livestock, and mining. There are rich stores of precious gems and minerals in the mountains.</p>
                    <p>The firstborn of every family in Selpharas is taken in by the church to be raised, educated, and, if selected - to become a host for the goddess. The majority of these children grow up to become priests and agents of the religion.</p>
                    <p>Selpharas is seen as a strange region as the strong, religious worship in the country is seen as cult-like from outsiders...</p>

                    <p><strong>How the rest of Tiranthe views them:</strong> Bad. They’re seen as really creepy and religious zealots in a death cult.</p>
                    <p><strong>Issues this country faces:</strong> Atheists, foreigners</p>
                    <p><strong>What’s the economy like?:</strong> Self-sufficient, they mostly export and trade agriculture and ores/minerals, but for the most part it’s a very simple pastoral land for most people outside of the church.</p>

                    <p><strong>What are the main languages spoken?:</strong> Common, Xanthi, elvish</p>
                    <p><strong>Where do most people live?:</strong> In the farmlands, the steppes, the lower regions of the mountains</p>
                    <p><strong>How does this country view magic?:</strong>  It’s nice and helpful, but something divine.</p>
                    <p><strong>How technologically advanced is this country? Is magic preferred?:</strong> Magic is preferred.</p>
                    <p><strong>How is history recorded?:</strong> Through books and scrolls written by scholars from the church.</p>
                    <p><strong>How many are educated, and how?:</strong> Perhaps a third, or half the population - the ones who go to educate themselves at the church</p>
                    <p><strong>How did the majority of current people come to be on this land?:</strong> Immigration. The Cyrilis elves, for example, migrated to Selpharas generations ago and evolved into their variation. The Xanthi migrated from the region over. </p>
                    <p><strong>Why do people choose to live here?:</strong> Religion, primarily. There is a lot of freedom as long as you don’t break any of the church’s tenets. Many older people or people close to death come here for a final resting place. Refugees from Andaras’ conquest have also travelled south.</p>
                    <p><strong>How popular is the government?:</strong> It’s a theocracy, so quite.</p>
                    <p><strong>How are criminals charged and punished?:</strong> They are put to trial before Sindariel whose divine justice charges them as guilty or innocent. If found guilty, they are usually put to death.</p>

                        <h3 class="poiret">Selpharas at a Glance</h3>
                        <p>Selpharim is the cold diamond at the center of the nation. It rests on the highest mountain in the nation, known as the Hollow Heights. High walls surround the closed city, giving the impression of an impenetrable fortress.</p>

                          <p>Outsiders know little about the city, the church, and its practices as one must receive a permit to even enter the country.</p>
                          
                          <p>While the capital appears to be quite modern and like a bustling metropolis, the rest of the region as it stretches out is more pastoral, with the bulk of the population involved with the trades and agriculture.</p>

                        <br>
                        <h3 class="poiret">The Church of Sindariel</h3>
                        <div class="smallestdivider">
                          <p>Church and State are not-so-separated here as it’s hard to keep a distinction when you have the divine at the helm.</p>
                          <p>Sindariel is the head of both state and church in the theocratic government. The hierarchical structure goes from Sindariel, to her masked Faithsguard, the Head Bishop, the Archbishops, to the Head Priests who overlook the Priests and Officers (who operate in more corporal roles), to the Reapers, to the Acolytes who are responsible for many day-to-day errands which help the operation run.</p>

                              <source type = "image/webp" srcset="/assets/sindariel_church_structure.d67341ef.webp ">

                              <img src="/assets/sindariel_church_structure.bd7e6206.png" alt="white coin with sindariel's face.">
                            </picture>
                          </div>

                          <p>Primarily the head Bishop enacts Sindariel’s will, and the goddess herself is rarely, if ever, seen in public. The one exception is on founder’s day, where she will make a ceremonial appearance to the people from the balcony of the church.</p>
                          <br>
                          <h3 class="poiret">Candidate for Goddess</h3>
                          <p>While all firstborns and orphans are taken in by the church to potentially become a vessel for Sindariel, not all are treated equally.</p>
                          <p>The children undergo training and education with occasional testing together until the beginning of puberty, where the most promising candidates are then segregated into a separate class. These potentials are moved to much nicer living quarters separate from the general trainees. They are treated with more respect and care from the staff. This has a tendency to create jealousy from the general trainees, who they share some common classes with. This can sometimes lead to bullying and discrimination against the potentials, but harming one of the potentials comes with great risk as those who are caught will be punished severely.</p>
                          <p>From the potentials, final candidates are chosen. This number varies, but is usually no more than two or three children. These children are once more segregated into the most exclusive lodgings and area of the sanctum. They no longer share classes, lodgings, or meals with the other residents. Candidates who reach adulthood are no longer considered viable vessels and removed from the program.</p>
                          <p>The remaining candidates from the general populace are often then trained and integrated for other parts of the church, with many assuming roles as priests and officers. There are even some who manage to work their way up to Head Priest. The highest one can ascend in the church theoretically is Head Bishop, though Sindariel personally selects the Head Bishop and the competition is bloody.</p>

                          <br>
                          <h3 class="poiret">Different Incarnations</h3>
                          <p>While every vessel is the goddess, different incarnations have slightly different policies for the church and state. Some may lean harder into the militaristic side, giving aid to the reapers and officers, while others may focus more on welfare and public works.</p>

                          <br>
                          <h3 class="poiret">Church and State</h3>
                          <p>The Church has a reciprocal relationship with the rest of the state. While they are the supreme power, they also serve the people with a communal mentality.</p>
                          <p>The further out from Selpharim the villages and hamlets are, the less faithful and orthodox they tend to be. To ensure Sindariel’s light still touches every part of the region, an outpost is placed in every settlement with a Priest from the church itself presiding over it. It also acts as a government office where citizens can receive aid, food, medicine, contact the church, send petitions, air their concerns, and report trouble or seek justice. In the same way, with the Priests acting as a gentle reminder of Sindariel’s reach, effectively making Selpharas a panopticon of sorts.</p>
                          <p>Due to this, despite the varying degree of faith, citizens generally have a favourable impression of the church, as well as a reliance on them.</p>

                          <br>
                          <h3 class="poiret">The Philosophy of Death</h3>
                          <p>"In Sindariel’s name, I release you. Rest in eternity’s embrace."</p>
                          <p>Death is not the end in Sindariel’s religion. It’s another new beginning as you will be reborn in a different form in your next life. If you have sinned greatly during your lifetime, however, it will be a long wait until your next incarnation, or you may be reborn as a lower lifeform.</p>
                          <p>While death is something to be accepted and at times celebrated, murder and suicide are still crimes in Selpharas as death is the Goddess’ domain and not something for mortals to interfere with. Only reapers are allowed to enact the Goddess’ will.</p>
                          <p>Those who commit crimes in Selpharas will stand trial before the holy court and receive Sindariel’s judgment themselves.</p>

                          <br>
                          <h3 class="poiret">Funeral Rites</h3>
                          <p>A vigil is held for the bodies in a ceremonial area, which is decorated with specially preserved flowers that only grow in the harsh Selpharan winter. Among them is said to be a single flower picked from Sindariel’s private garden. The body is left for viewing for three days so loved ones can pay respect.</p>
                          <p>After, they place the body in a coffin and exactly 3 of the deceased's family/loved ones must go on a pilgrimage with the body to the border of Ishari/Selpharas to bury it there. It's both for practical reasons, as the ground is typically frozen over and difficult to dig into, and for ceremonial/religious reasons. The pilgrimage itself meant to reflect the journey the deceased must take as they enter the cycle of life and rebirth again.</p>
                          <p>Graves are usually marked with either a symbol or a small statuette of Sindariel so she can watch over them.</p>

                        <p>The currency of Selpharas is called Indulgences. They just have the single coin, so those that live in Selpharas usually carry many of these coins on them. </p>
                        <p>For higher end, more expensive purchases, bartering is used instead of coinage.</p>
