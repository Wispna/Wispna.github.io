                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The country Nirios is settled on a peninsula. It prides itself on welcoming anyone, no matter your background or race, and pledges no allegiance to any other land or king. This, the balmy weather, and the port towns that dot Niros’s expansive coast have made the country a mixing pot of all sorts of people, most notably, pirates, and the largest merchant’s guild in Tiranthe. Though these two disparate groups often have their quarrels, they both agree that the freedom of Nirios is something that must be protected, and this has given the country a navy to be feared, and considerable financial strength.</p>
                    <p>Every 10 years, or whenever a council member dies, a vote is held in Thyta to fill the 30 positions for Nirios’s leading council. Nirios says it prides itself on letting anyone attempt to join the council, no matter race or creed, but it helps if one is wealthy or a captain of a ship known for heroic deeds.</p>

                    <p><strong>How the rest of Tiranthe views them:</strong> A neutral trade city. Many admire it for its free spirit, diversity, and acceptance of all races, but also fear it due to the large amount of pirates and thieves that make Nirios their home. If one wants to buy something, they can almost always find it in Nirios.</p>
                    <p><strong>Issues this country faces:</strong> Crime, lax laws. If a law is to be passed, it often takes a long time for the council to debate, and agree to it. Nirios will never take a side in a war, no matter how wrong a side may be, unless Nirios’s own interests are threatened.</p>
                    <p><strong>What’s the economy like?:</strong> Nirios is a very wealthy country due to its extensive trade.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What are the main languages spoken?:</strong> Trader’s common</p>

                    <p><strong>How technologically advanced is this country? Is magic preferred?:</strong> Magic and technology are viewed as equally useful. Nirios has good ships, but lax education. New technology or magical knowledge is often only heavily pursued if it’s believed to yield monetary gain.</p>
                    <p>Instead of cannons, Nirios's ships tend to employ mages for Naval attacks. Fire mages, wind mages, and water mages are considered to be of particular use on a ship.</p>
                    <p><strong>How is history recorded?:</strong> Written by anyone that comes to Nirios, and cares to write it, or through heroic stories.</p>
                    <p><strong>How many are educated, and how?:</strong> Not many. If you want an education in Nirios, you have to seek it out yourself. </p>
                    <p><strong>How did the majority of current people come to be on this land?:</strong> Some traveled here for acceptance and freedom, some traveled here for gold.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why do people choose to live here?:</strong> Some for acceptance and freedom, some because they’re a merchant and they wish to join the largest merchant's guild in Tiranthe, some because they’re a pirate.</p>
                    <p><strong>How popular is the government?:</strong> Fairly popular.</p>
                    <p><strong>How are criminals charged and punished?:</strong> Often criminal deeds are settled simply among the people of Nirios through duels, deals, or agreements, but if a crime is notable and bad enough, a criminal is tried by the council of Nirios, then given a punishment of imprisonment, public service, or death.</p>
