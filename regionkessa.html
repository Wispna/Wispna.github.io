                    <p><strong>Region Name:</strong> Kessa</p>
                    <p><strong>Capital City:</strong> Shenra</p>
                    <p><strong>Primary God:</strong> Alorel</p>
                    <p><strong>Races:</strong> approx.  32% Fae, 32% Human (primarily Kessan variant), 24% Elves (primarily Malverian variant), 8% Feroxi, 4% other.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Kessa spans both West and North of the continent’s capital, Myrenn. The old city of Raehn is in this region. This region is revered due to the numerous esteemed scholars and magical savants which the nation has produced, but it is also feared due to the mystic and enigmatic Fae residing in its southern forest. Kessa is the single region on the continent to contain Fae in such a high concentration, a fact which is enough to strike apprehension into the hearts of many.</p>
                    <p>The Mara mountains home most people in the region, its sides carved and insides chiselled away into the rocky architecture that people inhabit. Kessans are seen as peculiarly diplomatic by some, as their culture values worldliness and encourages its people to travel the continent to experience new things. Despite this openness, there is always an expectation that a Kessan’s home and heart will always be in Kessa, and that they will remember to return home and settle down when their travels are done.</p>
                    <p>The Crystal Elves are found in the city of Malveria in the Northernmost part of Kessa and the tallest peaks of the Mara mountains. This majestic city’s vastness lies in its height, in tall crystalline structures that rise above the mountain tops. Malveria is a beacon for magical and scientific discovery alike, but safekeeps much of its advancement for its own benefit. The city opens itself to few outside of its own, although it is more accepting of its Kessan neighbors and the nearby Elves of Wafetia than it is of others. Even at night, the city glows with magic.</p>

                    <p><strong>Region Name:</strong> Kessa</p>
                    <p><strong>Capital/Notable Cities:</strong></p>
                    <p> Shenra: The most populated of the various human settlements across the Mara mountains. An ancient underground passageway stems from this city; originally built to navigate under Mlneiro’s forest safely, the passageway has branched and evolved to be a complex network that few understand all the intricacies of in the present day.</p>
                    <p>Malveria: Home to Malverians, this majestic city’s vastness lies in its height, in tall crystalline structures that rise above the mountain tops. Malveria is a beacon for magical and scientific discovery alike, but safekeeps much of its advancement for its own benefit. Even at night, the city glows with magic</p>
                    <p>Mineiro's Forest: The heart of Fae culture- most of the stories surrounding it are superstition and speculation, as those who enter the forest are never seen or heard from again.</p>
                    <p><strong>Government Type:</strong> Representative democracy & meritocracy. There is an officially appointed ‘House of Scholars’ in Shenra. Every 6 years at a convention the lead scholar’s positions can be disputed and challenged by other qualified experts. All of those running for a position present their findings and accomplishments in their own field and there is a vote held by civilians who are registered under the same professional field. Voting is a right earned by completing one’s education and receiving an endorsement by a professional in the field you work in.</p>
                    <p><strong>Population:</strong> Medium sized.</p>
                    <p><strong>Population Type:</strong> approx.  32% Fae, 32% Human (primarily Kessan variant), 24% Elves (primarily Malverian variant), 8% Feroxi, 4% other.</p>
                    <p><strong>Primary God:</strong> Alorel</p>
                    <p><strong>Other Popular Gods</strong> Solq, Luwaria, Mido</p>
                    <p><strong>Major Landscapes:</strong> Mountains, Forest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Major Resources:</strong> Artisan crafts and goods, textiles, stone, iron, coal, medicine, alcohol and fermented… substances, perfume.</p>
                    <p><strong>General Climate:</strong> Mild temperatures which do not generally go below freezing, moderately rainy. </p>
                    <p><strong>Influence Over the World:</strong> Moderate. A notable diplomatic force with ties to many parts of Tiranthe.</p>

                    <p><strong>Issues this country faces:</strong> High standards and expectations for the “model citizen” (a person must travel, use their power to improve society, and cultivate a family legacy). There is high pressure to choose one’s path in life at a young age and never stray from it.</p>
                    <p>Older citizens and those with health problems can find themselves isolated to their towns, as traveling anywhere requires traversing the mountain landscape. Transporting goods and supplies can be an endeavor as well, particularly to smaller communities.</p>
                    <p>The proximity of the Fae is always a lingering fear and threat.</p>
                    <p><strong>What’s the economy like?:</strong> Fair. Kessa accepts all foreign currency, so it all circulates there along with the country’s own coinage.</p>
                    <p><strong>What is their currency called?:</strong> Daran</p>
                    <p><strong>What are the main languages spoken?:</strong>  Kessan and Trader’s common is spoken by all. Elven fluency is not uncommon, and is expected by any who expect to become a professional in the magical field. More translators and polyglots originate from Kessa than any other region.</p>
                    <p><strong>Where do most people live?:</strong> The capital, or in “research capitals”, cities within the region that have gained prestige for specific areas of study.</p>
                    <p><strong>How does this country view magic?:</strong> Positively. Kessa has a close bond to its neighboring elves (as well as the crystal elves) who value magical ability highly. Unlike the elves, however, it is still possible to be a respected Kessan without an ounce of magical ability.</p>
                    <p><strong>How technologically advanced is this country? Is magic preferred?:</strong> Technology and magic is seen equally, although cities closer to Wafetia tend to use more magic. Technology is advanced in its theory and invention in Kessa, although its implementation is often slow as there’s a lot of bureaucracy to ensure things are done the “proper” way. Technology reaches government and education institutions first and foremost, then businesses, with residential establishments having the lowest priority. This is part of the reason many Kessans live where they work. Kessans do not hesitate to use the technological advancements of other civilizations for its own benefit.</p>
                    <p><strong>How is history recorded?:</strong> There are many books in Kessa, and in many languages. This country places a cultural significance on each of its citizens keeping their own personal journals, which is one of the ways they have such a diverse view of history. In the capital, there’s a special underground library that exists solely for the sake of keeping and protecting the completed journals of citizens. The journals written during the time of its citizen’s travels are particularly valued.</p>
                    <p><strong>How many are educated, and how?:</strong> Everyone is educated. There is a particular emphasis on citizens learning to read and write the Kessan alphabet from a young age due to its difficult and complex nature.</p>
                    <p>The Kessans safeguard their writing system and one way they do this is by having compulsory public schooling which is the only way the writing system is taught, ensuring that only “true” Kessans (those born and raised in Kessa) learn it.</p>
                    <p>The Kessan writing system is rumored to originate from Sigildry, back from the days when Kessans disputed over forest territory with the Fae and had yet to migrate up into the Mara mountains to escape them altogether. Originally the writing system was meant to ward Fae from their towns in the form of charms and carvings outside their homes. The sigils evolved into codes as well- Kessans would carve codes and marks into the trees of the forest as a way to find their way through the manipulative and misdirecting nature of the Fae’s forest. This tradition carried on past the forest, the Kessans using their language as a sophisticated code built into the stone passages that they then built for themselves in the following millennia. Eventually, the system mutated and adopted influence from the Elven alphabet to become what it is today.</p>
                    <p><strong>How did the majority of current people come to be on this land?:</strong> they were born. Foreigners sometimes come here and are usually treated well, although they face difficulties assimilating into the culture and truly being accepted.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why do people choose to live here?:</strong> Family heritage and ties is a strong motivator to keep people from moving elsewhere. Citizens are cared for and society is peaceful.</p>
                    <p><strong>How popular is the government?:</strong> Most people don’t think much about it, which means it’s doing its job right. Usually politics moves slowly and is conservative when it comes to change.</p>
                    <p><strong>How are criminals charged and punished?:</strong>  Usually crime is persecuted when there is little doubt of the guilt of the accused. Criminals are sentenced and imprisoned, usually forcing a fine on their family. Tedious scribing and busywork keeps prisoners preoccupied, and those who cooperate and are more productive in their time there may have their sentences shortened.</p>

                    <p>The Kessan currency is called the "Daran" which are flat coins of different sizes and values. They are composed of different petrified materials (wood, plant) and smooth polished stone, with symbols carved on the surface. The smallest coin is worth about 1/4th of a Daran, then there are coins of 1, 10, 50, 100 value. For larger domestic transactions, it's also possible exchange coins for bank notes of larger amounts if needed, but most individuals stick to coins.</p>
