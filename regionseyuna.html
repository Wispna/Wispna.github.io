                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Above water island for the mermaids, used for diplomacy, and any residents who prefer to live above water. This place is near Aeyoqia, which is the capital of Yuani. The island is Monsoon climate type, which means there are general dry-ish seasons which do not receive much rainfall, but still a sustainable enough amount, then seasons where it is completely drenched with rainfall. Instead of wooden trees it is mostly extremely huge plants.</p>
                    <p>Seyuna, due to its location and environment, makes a great place for research. It’s most notable research area is its university, called Senyan University. Senyan does not discriminate against who attends, and uses that to its advantage by having native professors teach about different subjects. Seyuna has a couple of the only universities that have extensive research about the ocean and Yuani itself.</p>

                    <p>Senyan University is the most famous school of magic in all of Tiranthe. It is a bastion of knowledge, and anyone is able to learn its curriculum as long as they pass a complicated and eccentric entry exam that changes yearly, or can afford the tuition. </p>

                            <p>The entry exam for Senyan University changes every year. It is created by one of Senyan University's 7 masters (the master who makes it is randomly chosen each year), and is often eclectic. The master that created the exam is kept secret, and part of the exam is finding out which master created it as then you can get hints on what the subject matter might be.</p>
                            <p>One year a maze was erected in front of the university that aspiring students had to solve. Another year the exam was that a mysterious egg had to be raised and hatched into a healthy creatures. Another year complicated puzzle boxes were handed out to everyone who wanted to apply, and the first 100 that managed to solve it were welcomed as one of the university's students. Of course the exam can be entirely avoided if your family pays enough for your entry.</p>

                    <h3 class="poiret">7 Fields of Study</h3>
                    <p>1. Physica - Studies the non magical laws of the world. Physics, Mathematics, and Geometry belong to this domain.</p>
                    <p>2. Arcanum - Studies the magical laws of the world. Such things as elemental power, the elements themselves, crystals that can hold magic, affinities, and unusual magical abilities are studied in this field.</p>
                    <p>3. Archival - Studies history, recorded knowledge, culture, and languages. Students here often spend time poring over the texts in the massive library, or are out traveling the world to gather and record more knowledge.</p>
                    <p>4. Naturae - Studies the natural world, and creatures and plants throughout Tiranthe. Many students in this field also spend much time traveling through Tiranthe. </p>
                    <p>5. Rhetorica - Studies rhetoric, philosophy, warfare, diplomacy, and economics. Known colloquially as the ‘rich bastard’ field. Many young nobles are sent to Senyan university to excel in this field of study, and learn the art of ruling. </p>
                    <p>6. Aesthetics - Studies art, music, fashion, and the concept of beauty. Also studies how art has the capability to communicate without words.</p>
                    <p>7. Medica - Studies medicine, herbology, anatomy, and illnesses of both the body and the mind. </p>

                  <p>A student does not need to dedicate themselves to one field of study, but dedication in one can lead to full mastery. Each field has a symbol that represents it: physica - triangle, arcanum - magic circle, archival - quill, naturae - leaf, rhetorica - star, aesthetics - flower, medica - human heart.</p>
                  <p>Every student is given a pin to represent their interest and mastery in that field. Each pin is in the shape of the field's symbol, and they’re made of different materials to represent mastery.</p>
                  <p>
                    Copper - A student without mastery
                    <br>
                    Silver - A student or teacher with mastery over one subject within their field.
                    <br>
                    Gold - A student or teacher with mastery over multiple subjects within their field.
                    <br>
                    Crystal - A student or teacher that is considered a foremost expert within their field. 
                    <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>For someone to be considered as having mastery over a subject, they must complete a thesis on that subject.</p>
                  <p>Senyan University doesn’t have a single headmaster, but is instead led by the seven masters, each one who rules over a particular field. The master is considered a foremost expert in their field, and if one wishes to take a master's place, a student can challenge them. The master can then choose a challenge in which the student must compete against them in, and the winner of the challenge becomes, or continues as, the master. The university masters vote on any university matters.</p>
                  <p>There is a myth of an original underwater university that Senyan has a secret entryway to that is full of ancient knowledge. </p>
