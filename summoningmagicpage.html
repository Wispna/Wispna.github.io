                            <p>Summoning is a rare magic, and its existence is unknown to most. It’s a power that one cannot have been born with-- if one wants to become a summoner, they must seek out the ancient knowledge, and then learn to make contact with the Chaos Realm to make a pact with their chosen Chaos Being. As a result, summoners tend to be more academic types. Once the pact is made, the summoner must give up being able to use the element they have an affinity for, and must come to terms with that when they die, the Chaos Being will consume them to absorb what remaining magic they have. When the pact is made a pact mark will form somewhere on the summoner’s body, and from then on they will be able to draw from the Chaos Being’s power.</p>
                            <p>Few know the complete details of summoning, but many fear and despise what they do know of it. Pact marks are reviled, and summoned creatures are believed to be of the truest evil. If a summoner reveals the true nature of their summoning magic to too many, it’s likely they’ll be sentenced to death.</p>

                        <p>The Chaos Realm is a dimension that rests besides our own. It has many similarities to the dimension Tiranthe is in, but the laws of nature aren’t the same. Gravity doesn’t always fall down, solid isn’t always solid, things aren’t always what they appear to be, time doesn’t always flow there correctly, and in many places, beasts and nature have been twisted. The Chaos dimension is also shattered into pieces. Being able to travel there often means you’ll only have access to a small piece of it, and won’t be able to see all that it has to offer.</p>
                        <p>If one stays in the Chaos Realm for longer than 3 days, and manages to survive, they may start to feel themselves fall apart. Nobody, not even summoners, is able to permanently take objects from the Chaos Realm into their dimension. They can store stuff within their chaos dimension, but only if it's non magical. </p>
                        <p>Ancient mages used to be able to use pieces of the Chaos Realm for their own desires, but such magic proved to be unstable and often deadly. Nowadays, only a few Chaos Realm related artifacts remain.</p>

                        <p>Chaos Beings are creatures that have lived in the chaos realm for eons, and many have gained sentience and immense power. Many crave the stable magic from outside the Chaos Dimension, but they are unable to travel between dimensions on their own, and they fear that the gods may smite them if they take what isn’t their own. Some have instead tried to gain the magic they desire by making pacts with willing mages, while others try to gain the magic by consuming mages foolish enough to travel to the Chaos Realm in the first place.</p>
                        <p>You are free to design what the Chaos Being you’ve made a pact with looks like, but keep in mind that they tend to look monstrous.</p>

                        <p>Pact marks can be anywhere on the body, and can be any symbol and any size. They look like tattoos of black ink. When you summon your creature in its true form to your dimension, the pact marks will emit a smoke, cloud, or mist of your elemental affinity.</p>

                        <p>You can only have one character with summoning.</p>
                        <p>​Once you take up summoning, your character will no longer be able to use their affinity element. The element will still be their affinity, and will still affect the allocation point prices of other elements, but summoning will take the place of the actual magic used, as your Pact Creature will be consuming your elemental affinity magic to be able to exist. Summoning will also be the same price to buy as your elemental affinity, so minor spells will always cost 3 points, moderate will always cost 5 points, and major will always cost 7 points. If you give summoning to an already existing character, you may switch out all skills bought for your elemental affinity with equal skills in summoning.</p>
                        <p>You will also have to make the Chaos Being your character made a pact with. These are sentient, and almost like a character of their own. Their backstory will always be that they have spent their entire lives in a piece of the Chaos dimension, and they will always have the desire to consume your magic when able. If you summon them during combat, or get the ability that lets them remain in the Tiranthe dimension, they will generally only be able to communicate with your summoner. They will only be able to communicate with others if the summoner feeds that other person their blood, and this communication will only last a day.</p>
                        <p>You also have the option to make the section of the Chaos Realm that your Chaos Being resides in. It can be anything, but it must have elements of Chaos in it, and you will not be able to take objects from the Chaos Realm into your character’s dimension. Buying enough levels in Creation/Summon will allow you to travel to this section of the Chaos realm at will.</p>
                        <p>Unless the choice is justified in the character backstory, a summoner should have at least 3 skill points in academics and at least 3 in sorcery.</p>
                        <p>Summoners cannot have more than 3 skill points in blessings.</p>
