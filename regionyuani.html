                    <p><strong>Region Name:</strong> Yuani</p>
                    <p><strong>Capital City:</strong> Aeyoqia</p>
                    <p><strong>Primary God:</strong> Luwaria</p>
                    <p><strong>Races:</strong> 90% Mermaid, 4% Dragon, 5% Water Elemental, 1% Other</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong>The inner workings of the sea are not very widely known, so many land regions may not know much about Yuani. The underwater region is specialized in trading due to its easy passageways to different ports. It has one large island called Seyuna where interregional relations take place as well as local trade and other business. This region has a heavy focus on education, with one of the highest literacy rates among the world. They are obsessed with efficiency, however, and their methodology of dealing with crimes and criminals can be considered unconventional. Criminals are put into “rehabilitation” where they are rigorously educated until they are considered “fit for society.”</p>
                    <p>There is a 3 part political system that is dominated by the 3 inter-regions of the sea, which are Shore, Open Ocean, and The Abyss. The leader, called a Khyuhaya, is voted by the residents of the sea. Typically, The Abyssals win the elections - this stems from societal prejudice of Abyssals being considered the wiser, more established race and being put into places of power. A crown is passed each time power changes hands, and has been long passed down since the beginnings of the underwater society. The Abyss is considered mysterious, due to most merfolk not being able to reach it from the intense water pressure that only Abyssal Merfolk can withstand.</p>
                    <p>Their primary dialect is Open Ocean, due to it being the largest section of the ocean. A sign of wealth is wearing long, draping clothing, which implies you are not of the working class, since cloth would get snagged easily if it was too long. Typically, residents of the sea have familial jewels that are either passed down or crafted within the family.</p>

                    <p><strong>Government Type:</strong> Democracy</p>
                    <p><strong>Population:</strong> So… so many. It’s the ocean. Highest population out of all of the continents due to sheer size of the ocean.</p>
                    <p><strong>Population Type:</strong> 90% Mermaid, 1% Marked (Elf, Human, Feroxi), 4% Dragon, 5% Water Elemental</p>
                    <p><strong>Primary God:</strong>  Luwaria</p>
                    <p><strong>Other Popular Gods</strong> Nahite, Saiphina</p>
                    <p><strong>Major Landscapes:</strong> Warm Ocean, Open Ocean, Deep Ocean</p>
                    <p><strong>Major Resources:</strong> Pearls, Dyes, Coral, Medicine, Gemstones, Core Stone</p>
                    <p><strong>General Climate:</strong> Due to mostly everything being underwater, the only ‘climate’ is the temperature, which largely stays within a small range year round. The island is Monsoon climate type, which means there are general dry-ish seasons which do not receive much rainfall, but still a sustainable enough amount, then seasons where it is completely drenched with rainfall. </p>
                    <p><strong>Influence Over the World:</strong> Trading, trading, trading! Since large amounts of trade is most quickly done through sea, this country is mostly responsible for guiding trade routes through the adequate areas. Though each place has their own burial practices, some rest their recently passed into their river, where it passes through into the ocean, and lands in special underwater burial places, where they eventually turn into stones. </p>

                    <p><strong>How the rest of Tiranthe views them:</strong> Neutral, mysterious, not much is known about their culture, typically just an interaction to be had to make trade. </p>
                    <p><strong>Issues this country faces:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Some discrimination, the Abyssals are regarded to be higher than the other two races.</li>
                      <li>Large disparity between the rich and the poor, typically higher paying jobs are mostly just government jobs</li>
                      <li>On the verge of political turmoil, due to differing opinions on the voting/political system, and other arguments about how one small set of people shouldn’t be governing the entire ocean.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>What’s the economy like?:</strong> Money is not being distributed very fairly, making large pay gaps between each social class. Many poor people choose to live in the middle of nowhere to not have to deal with ridiculous taxes, making them prone to tax evasion, but it is either live isolated or go to prison. The ocean is certainly big enough to hide in, but currently one of the bigger issues in government is how to fix that problem, making the lower class anxious in their future. </p>
                    <p><strong>What is their currency called?:</strong> Yuns</p>
                    <p><strong>What are the main languages spoken?:</strong> Mostly Open Ocean dialect, Abyssal involves more clicks and isn’t understandable to those outside the Abyss, due to it not being taught outside of the area. Those from the Abyss use that to hold it against everyone else. Warm water is typically like Open Ocean, but more with the accents of the country above it. </p>
                    <p><strong>Where do most people live?:</strong> Open Ocean is most friendly, only the Abyssal live in the deep ocean, and Warm Water mermaids can either live around corals or warm waters or potentially live on the surface. </p>
                    <p><strong>How does this country view magic?:</strong> Very highly! A lot of technology is based off magic in the ocean, due to not being able to have much of a light/power source without it being so far into the water. Without magic, most things would be reduced to a very archaic state. Non-magical means of living is considered obsolete. Those who learn light magic are particularly useful, since they are needed to create lamps and other devices needing light. Though, most who live in the Abyss know dark magic, therefore not needing much light magic, and their cities largely unlit and hard to locate. </p>
                    <p><strong>How technologically advanced is this country? Is magic preferred?:</strong> Very technologically advanced! Knowledge is power, and that sentiment is widely pushed throughout the country. Since most aspire to climb up the social ladder, it is common for people to be studious in both magic and technology, making expectations higher and more cut throat on who is most innovative/useful. Most cities are built for high function, and with the use of magic, more and more is controlled and regulated without the need of another person. Because of this, not many common jobs are available for people. A high bar is set into place, being that if you are not working in a large company or the government, you will most likely be in the lower class. </p>
                    <p><strong>How is history recorded?:</strong> History is largely recorded through technological means, but there will always be a hard copy made, and that copy will be sent to a large library to be archived. </p>
                    <p><strong>How many are educated, and how?:</strong> Almost all of the population that is old enough to go to school is educated. It is highly illegal to take your child out of school, up until the child is of legal adult age, and being homeschooled is very rare, having to go through many regulations before it is allowed to occur. Almost all of the population chooses to pursue higher education, due to most jobs being in big companies, while casual jobs are very rare, or are in small, poor towns. </p>
                    <p>Schooling is one of the top priorities in this country, so much so that teachers are put into high regard and are part of the middle or upper class. It is paramount for the youth to be adequately prepared for the future, so only the best of the best teachers are those who thrive in this country’s system. Schools are large, classrooms purposely with a small pool of children so there is more focused learning from teacher to student, with an adequate blend of technology to aid learning. Most students have a questionnaire they must fill out every year as to their learning preferences, accompanied by how the teachers assess their performance throughout the year. </p>
                    <p><strong>How did the majority of current people come to be on this land?:</strong> They were either born there or are from a very slim ancestry of those who have the Mark of the Ocean. </p>
                    <p><strong>Why do people choose to live here?:</strong> It’s all they’ve ever known, or because of how much technology is involved in their life, making living elsewhere difficult. </p>
                    <p><strong>How popular is the government?:</strong> Half and half. Some people hate it a lot, some people thrive by it. </p>
                    <p><strong>How are criminals charged and punished?:</strong> Every single person can be redeemable. Though that sentiment is typically something good, it could be put to the extreme in this country. When you are taken into prison, you do not actually stay for very long. In this country, they believe that education is everything, even if you have to be taught how to act. So, in prison, they wipe you of your memory in hopes to reteach how to behave accordingly to society’s standards. Most find it useless to waste the government’s resources and space to keep people in captivity and to maintain them, so it is most optimal to simply reteach them and send them back into the world. Though, it is marked on your record if you go to prison, and will be in a system of people that the police quietly keep tabs on just in case of relapse. Though, this sort of thing is more for extreme crimes, like murder, rape, pedophilia, and along that line of extremeness. </p>
                    <p>Things like tax evasion, drug distribution, burglary, etc are not punished to that extreme. Instead, they are brought to psychologists and rehabilitation centers in hopes of correcting their ways. Though, if the issue is constant in and out due to inability to pay taxes, they are sent off to a low income, undesirable area to be able to be put to work without pay until they pay off the amount of taxes they did not pay. </p>

They each have a circle cut out in them for both conveniences sake so a thread may be threaded through them for easier transport, and so that one may hold a yun up to the sky, look through the hole, and see the moon through it. </p>
