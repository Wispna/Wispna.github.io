                    <p><strong>Region Name:</strong> Vieru</p>
                    <p><strong>Capital City:</strong> N/A</p>
                    <p><strong>Primary God:</strong> Nhysannia</p>
                    <p><strong>Races:</strong> 60% swamp elves, 30% swamp merpeople, 5% swamp elementals, 5% other</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Vieru is a swamp that borders both Andaras and Wafeitia. If asked, Andaras would claim the swamp as being their territory, but the actual swamp denizens consider this a humorous assumption.</p>
                    <p>Vieru was created a couple of thousand years ago when a large magical disaster in an attempt to create new life on the level of the gods occurred (apparently sygaldry-related?). The sheer amount of magic warped the land and life around it, changing it into something completely new and terrifying. </p>
                    <p>Much of the ground is covered in inches of water, and massive trees grow from the marshy grounds, their enormous leaves blotting out the light of the sun in much of the swamp. </p>
                    <p>Bioluminescent plants and fungi light some areas with an alien light, and strange creatures unseen anywhere else in Tiranthe lurk in the darkness.</p>
                    <p>A stone statue of an elven woman with her arms raised sits in the center of the swamp, but if one draws too close, their body is warped by the magic until they die, or become a mindless beast.</p>
                    <p>Those born in the swamp cannot leave the swamp, as they require the magic there to live. They’ve created a life for themselves however, often residing in treetops, and forming intricate pathways of tree branches that they’ve walked all their lives to traverse the dangerous land. <span class="blue">No characters can be from Vieru.</span> Characters may have stopped by Vieru on their travels, however.</p>

                    <p><strong>God/Goddess Name:</strong> Nhysannia</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Goddess of the Swamp/Living embodiment of the swamp</p>
                    <p>Nhysannia is worshiped nowhere but Vieru Swamp, where they consider her the only goddess that matters. She is considered the living embodiment of the swamp, and is considered to exist in all aspects of it, only sometimes taking the form of an elven woman to communicate with a lucky few.</p>
                    <p>Devout worshipers sometimes paint her tranquil face on their ceiling, believing her gaze will protect them for the more horrible denizens of where they live.</p>
                    <p>Other gods do not consider Nhysannia a true god, but rather a construction of mortal beliefs, and magic. </p>

                  </div> 

                  <div class="tab-pane clearfix" id="three" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="three-tab"> 
                    <ul>
                      <li>Nearly everyone in Vieru has a tattoo somewhere visible on their body to show that they belong to a certain village. You only don’t have this tattoo if you’re very young, or if you don’t belong to one of three subgroups. (many have pendants with the same symbol too. It’s said this tradition began so that if your body was found somewhere in the swamp, it could be returned to the right village for a proper funeral)</li>
                      <br>
                      <li>One of these subgroups is a group of extremists known as the Swamp Worshipers. They worship Nhysannia and the larger swamp beasts, and dislike any that speak of wishing to leave Vieru. Some believe they can speak to Nhysannia, and have a strange connection with the massive beasts there.</li>
                      <br>
                      <li>The other subgroup is the wanderers. These people have no home, and are unpredictable. </li>
                      <br>
                      <li>The last subgroup is people that aren’t from Vieru. These people are rare, as most of the time they just die to the swamp’s dangers.</li>
                      <br>
                      <li>Another important group in Vieru are The Guides. Guides are people strong enough to face the dangers of the swamp, and their job is a mix of being a navigator, a bodyguard, and a scientist. They are often respected, but also often feared due to their rituals being secret, and some believing that they made a pact with the more unsavory things in the swamp. </li>
                      <br>
                      <li>Guides have powerful elemental magic, and carry a piece of their element in a container that they carry with them. They are unable to do the creation aspect of magic, but this is balanced by how much more powerful their manipulation and sensing is. </li>
